# Introduction
**We are going open-source! :two_hearts:**

This is the official GitHub repository for [#MamaNyoSquad](http://github.com/MamaNyoSquad), reliving the DOA hype through web presence among others! This brand is run by two people: [thebelovedmoon (G.Mgr)](http://github.com/thebelovedmoon) and [Emmannuel Ortega (SocWeb Mgr)](http://github.com/Ortega082)!

# Why have you decided to go open-source?
Following the recent website policy imposed by the previous provider, Bookmark, we have decided to explore alternatives without any need of risky pricing. As you may have noticed, though this is run by two people, we are on a tight budget so we are unable (at least for the time being) to accomodate such incredible pricing ranges. And besides, going open-source means we are transparent in our own way, as most of our code is transmitted through this repository.

# Is the website (and repository) licensable?
Yes! Our web presence, being on an open-source platform, is licensed under **Creative Commons Zero (CC0) 1.0 Universal**, which can be read via this [file](http://github.com/MamaNyoSquad/mamanyosquad.github.io/blob/main/LICENSE) (this change has been in effect via this [commit](http://github.com/MamaNyoSquad/mamanyosquad.github.io/commit/cf6f42377dde718495347c419f10a1f736862aae)).

# Are the Site Policies still in effect?

# KT Disclosure
_Enforced 20 July 2021 Venus Island Time (UTC)_

This information contains some general information and enforcing mechanisms regarding content originated from KOEI TECMO GAMES (and KT Holdings).

## Introduction
#MamaNyoSquad is a community-based, non-incorporating organization managed or operated by an individual or two that makes use of assets from other sources.

We understood the risk of some assets being classified as non-distributable materials, and we govern that the assets are handled with integrity in mind.

## Handling the Assets
Most of the assets that are displayed on this website are not our sole property, therefore it's our responsibility to handle them without causing any harm to the parties involved.

The way we handle the assets may depend on the situation given: Either we display the assets, disclosing the attribution from another source or property; or make our own rendition of existing assets given the amount of time allotted before the display of such assets.

We may also acquire additional assets that may not have been disclosed to the public before a specific date. As such, we will apply a disclaimer and/or additional security measures given as part of our handling measures.

## Properties
We are complying with the best we can to ensure no damages have been warranted against the use of such assets.

We may be prompted to remove the assets and/or take down if they deem we violated their properties, with or without question. In case of infringement, please contact us by Email or Twitter DM.

We may also send them a formal permission to use the assets as long as such are not violated under such properties. Failure to do so, when prompted however, may result in what cited on paragraph two.

As such, we may resort to citing attributions and/or disclaimers for the meantime. See section "Handling the Assets" for information.

## Additional Information
We may garner additional information that may or may not be related to the overall subject matter, such as news and social information.

As such, we may classify such information, although some may be moved to a different channel because of urgent reasons.

We may be using the assets in order to depict the information given. See section "HOW WE HANDLE THE ASSETS" for information. For intellectual properties, see "Properties" section.

## Conclusion
Such assets that we displayed on this website are by no means our property, and we will take responibility for any damages given by such liabilities. NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED.

# How about the Open Letter?
Since Bookmark has unpublished (and restricted exporting of) websites that are affected by their new Pricing Policy, the Open Letter which originated from there has disappeared. However, we have managed to obtain the most recent one which discloses as follows:

## An Open Letter to Bookmark
_Published 13 April 2022 at 12:54pm UTC_

We, whom have been your loyal customers on the platform, are saddened by the sudden concurrent changes that has affected our workflows. It has been such a pain to be able to maintain our social presence across the Internet without worrying when our features are going to be limited anytime soon. And most importantly, we are in a deep worry that due to the new pricing guidelines, our free websites--like this one--is bound to be deleted soon. (We have made backups of it just in case, so that we won't lose any hard work, but nonetheless.)

As such, we've been staying on this platform for many months (if not a year or two), freely customizing our websites as we wish without any worry of limitations. We have been so grateful to be provided many new features that will enhance the website experience, but that came at a cost: We need to pay to utilize the advanced services and keep our websites active.

Now, we understand that these paid services are the 'keys' to improving the site experience, but please understand that some customers of this platform can't stay longer because when their "Free Trial" ends, they MUST PAY to continue using the service; whereas themselves have a tight budget or have no budget at all.

Because of these sudden changes, those who are in that sector have a choice to pay up to continue using the basic services after the trial, or remove from the platform.

Before we move on, we just wanted to mention that restricting customizations is a real pain considering that some websites have individual customization settings before this sudden change, like in Emmannuel's case, in which he tweeted at 8:11am UTC. In a nutshell, the websites after this update have restricted the customizations (llike header and footer) to apply globally. What's worse is that unlike the last update [as we can remember] that you limited our free websites to 5, you haven't pushed future updates to your customers, which proves that the changes are sudden without their notice.

We are appealing to Bookmark to reconsider other options considering the no-budget customers like us and features that we deem are demanding to be returned, amongst other considerations not mentioned in this open letter.

**Addendum**

As per release of this open letter, all websites owned by thebelovedmoon and Emmannuel Ortega are put ON HOLD as the migration is underway to a new [temporary] provider. Also, we might consider staying on the platform if the finances are into account, but for now, this letter comes into effect.

# What holds the future of an open-sourced #MamaNyoSquad?
We have been working on engaging others to collaborate with our work as we move forward, beginning with the rewrite of Venus Island Diaries - Main Story (more in this [Tweet](http://mobile.twitter.com/i/status/1514422387961638918)). With this initiative, we are committed for a future where everyone can share ideas freely, interact with one's work, and bring their ideas to life!

# Conclusion
As we move forward through an open-sourced future, we are still expecting some hurdles. Though it is certain that those can lead to a more fulfilling future that everyone can achieve just by collaborating with each other!

***Enter the universe through the eyes of the Tengu!***
