# Introduction

**We are going open-source! :two_hearts:**

This is the official GitHub repository for [#MamaNyoSquad](https://github.com/MamaNyoSquad), reliving the DOA hype through web presence among others! This brand is run by two people: [thebelovedmoon (General Manager)](https://github.com/thebelovedmoon) and [Emmannuel Ortega (Social & Web Manager)](https://github.com/Ortega082)!

# Why have you decided to go open-source?

Following the recent website policy imposed by the previous provider, Bookmark, we've decided to explore alternatives without any need of risky pricing. As you may have noticed, though this is run by two people, we're on a tight budget so we're unable (at least for the time being) to accommodate such incredible pricing ranges. And besides, going open-source means we're transparent in our own way, as most of our code is transmitted through this repository (via `deploy` branch).

# Is the website (and repository) licensable?

Yes! Starting 11 May 2023 UTC, our repository has TWO licenses:

- The site's source code, the framework that powers up the whole website and is hosted by GitHub Pages, is licensed under **MIT License**, which can be found [here](LICENSE). _This is our Root License._
- The site's contents -- like text, images and the like -- are licensed under **CC-BY 4.0 INTL and above**, which can be found [here](LICENSE-CONTENT).

For transparency, our Pull Requests which include the category <span style="background-color: #a31f34; padding: 1.9px 4.75px; border-radius: 950px; color: #fff'">**LICENSE UPDATE**</span> is found [here](https://github.com/MamaNyoSquad/mamanyosquad.github.io/pulls?q=is:pr+label:%22LICENSE+UPDATE%22).

# Where is the Site Policies and KT Disclosure?

We've moved such policies to this [page](https://mamanyosquad.github.io/policies).

# How about the Open Letter?

Since Bookmark has unpublished (and restricted exporting of) websites that are affected by their new Pricing Policy, the Open Letter which originated from there has disappeared. However, we've managed to obtain the most recent one which discloses as follows:

## An Open Letter to Bookmark

We've moved the Open Letter to the Blog! Check [here](https://mamanyosquad.github.io/blog/20220413) for details.

# What holds the future of an open-sourced #MamaNyoSquad?

We've been working on engaging others to collaborate with our work as we move forward, beginning with the rewrite of [Venus Island Diaries - Main Story](https://bit.ly/VIDiariesRealTime). With this initiative, we're committed for a future where everyone can share ideas freely, interact with one's work, and bring their ideas to life!

# Conclusion

As we move forward through an open-sourced future, we're still expecting some hurdles. Though it is certain that those can lead to a more fulfilling future that everyone can achieve just by collaborating with each other!
