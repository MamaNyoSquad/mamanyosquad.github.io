      <h1>An Open Letter to Streamers</h1>
      <em>published 31 December 2023 UTC</em>
      <p>
        The G.Mgr -- representing 「VTresMarias - V三人のマリア - 」 -- sends out an
        Open Letter in response to all the fiasco caused by the Twitch Meta
        popularized by AsianBunnyx and Morgpie; and severed by MarinaVT, Firedancer,
        and Amouranth -- among others.
      </p>
      <div class="inThisArticle"></div>
      <div class="secContain">
        <p>
          I’m writing this Open Letter in response to all of what has happened on the
          Twitch Platform. I’m sincerely disheartened by what the platform has become
          thanks to the responses to these new rules in place. To give you some details
          on how it all went down, here’s some retrospective:
        </p>
        <p>
          8 Dec began the unprecedented uprising of this new Twitch “meta trend” thanks
          to Twitch Partner and OnlyFans model Morgpie -- who claimed to have gotten the
          inspiration from AsianBunnyx. This “meta” consists of a female or a
          female-presenting individual being close to the camera enough to show that
          she/they’re “topless” -- where in Morgpie’s case (in an interview with
          Dexerto) she alleged that she’s fully clothed, implying that her clothes have
          no straps on them, and that AsianBunnyx started it all. In response to this
          new “meta”, many female-presenting streamers and VTubers have caught on to it
          and decided that they should try it for themselves -- creating what we call a
          “butterfly effect”.
        </p>
        <p>
          el_XoX has started this effect in the VTubing space, constituting the change
          from the “butterfly effect” to a “ripple effect” -- where many VTubers have
          hopped in this new boom. MochiiMochiiVT and Leahkitties, who have been among
          my mutual friends on X, have been reported to have maintained that effect,
          according to FalseEyeD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the change, Twitch has initially decided to change its sexual
          content policies to properly align with “feedback” from the streamers --
          including to supposedly allow artistic nudity, which according to our research
          and some accounts, mostly apply to artists who are drawing on-stream.
          Regardless, it won’t take long after the changes to effect for streamers and
          VTubers to get ahead of the competition with something
          <em>obviously</em> inappropriate in nature.
        </p>
        <p>To this, I say: <strong>Thanks, MarinaVT.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Twitch Partner MarinaVT, one of the LGBT+ VTubers and the founder of VT
          Rainbow, has been the cause of some of the ordeals according to some accounts
          -- including the supposed victory against Pikamee because of Hogwarts Legacy
          (in which it was revealed in the reports that she has been considering for a
          long time, but fell at a wrong time due to that) and alleged arranged
          harassment against people who are against her views. On 14 Dec, a new ordeal
          has been brought upon her as she made an already-deleted post on X containing
          an artwork classified as obviously-implied nudity and her “nude” model adhered
          to Morgpie’s “meta”, with a caption “celebrating degeneracy LIVE on Twitch”.
          Hours into the stream, Twitch issued a 24-hour ban against her because of
          implied nudity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This unprecedented but extremely dangerous stunt has been the talk all day
          long, from Dexerto’s initial reportage of the issue to Linus Media Group’s
          TechLinked, with one of its hosts Riley Murdock describing the situation as a
          “biblical deluge” -- referring to Twitch’s Art category filled with sexually
          explicit content regardless of medium.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the credit of Twitch, they have ultimately reversed the decision on
          artistic nudity, stating that “they went too far with this decision” and that
          “streamers, after realizing the update, has created content that has obviously
          violated the policies regarding adult content; with some contents under
          current policies put the communities under concern” -- putting the blow on
          artists who just want to draw some stuff.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What Marina did in the stream that has caused the reversal of the policy is
          utterly inexcusable and unacceptable. And in my perspective, thoroughly
          containing the situation isn’t going to cut it.
          <em>The internet, and the screenshots, never forget.</em>
        </strong></p>
        <p>
          After casually checking on the posts featuring her (most notably Dexerto),
          GLYTCH Energy has removed her from the list of sponsorees after they learned
          about the ordeal thanks to the interactions in their posts. Marina did
          apologize, but I personally feel that more had to be done other than just
          making multiple lines of apologies in a post.
        </p>
        <p>
          To echo what I said in a Special Report dated 15 Dec: “To take things too far
          and let it be fully open in a usual 13+ platform is not something that can
          positively impact an audience in some way or another. What you did is
          inexcusable. There are a lot of 18+ or adult-only sites that you can
          participate in, like XVideos, PornHub, and OnlyFans (though I can confirm that
          you did 18+ shenanigans on Fansly); but Twitch is NOT and WILL NEVER be one of
          them.”
        </p>
        <p>
          After the supposed rule, it appears many streamers have been striving to “test
          beyond the limits” when it comes to sexual contents. And I mean a LOT of them,
          as Dexerto had covered.
        </p>
        <p>So I’ll say once again: <strong>Thanks, Firedancer.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Dexerto has revealed last 20 Dec that a new “meta trend” has taken place
          thanks to another Twitch Partner and OnlyFans model named Firedancer --
          Firedancer121 on X -- that appeared to have censor bars on stream. Despite
          clarifying that she wore clothes before the censor bars were introduced, this
          has caught on many streamers -- or should I say “streamers” at this point? --
          who have used this kind of trend, like the likes of Twitch Partners LilacLove
          and Kidi. Another Twitch Partner and OnlyFans model Amouranth has taken censor
          bars to the next level by making censor bars physical. How on earth?
        </p>
        <p>
          To the point that even it made sense that someone is as disappointed as I am,
          one clip shared by Dexerto showed the wife of Twitch Affiliate ShaneYit being
          unhappy throughout the whole clip as soon as she got in to check up on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make matters even worse, another Twitch Partner Boogie2988 has revealed to
          stream WITHOUT everything on -- causing him to get banned last 23 Dec. He was
          unbanned 3 days later.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
          So, what’s the current state of Twitch now that it has come to this?
        </strong></p>
        <p>
          This has been a very difficult state considering the mentality of some
          streamers. Such like these have an impact that can affect the morality of
          those who watched those contents.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a streamer, it’s been a struggle having a middle ground that caters to the
          viewers’ demands and at the same time abide by the rules. As an
          <em>actual</em> streamer, I employ my own style of providing content while
          still being on that ‘middle ground’ approach that satisfies the platform and
          the fans -- to which I admit we all have our own style of content. But to
          think that streamers copy others because of such popularity or trends like
          this has made me realize how screwed-up we were as fellow streamers. I
          understand that they’re trying to catch up to trends that they believe are fun
          and engaging, but always remember that trends are not what they seem. They can
          be fun, sure; but there are some trends that are downright dangerous. There
          are trends that can ruin the viewers’ hearts (like that so-called “graduation
          post” copypasta), and trends that can ruin your life like what we brought up
          in this open letter. We’re all trying to make a buck out of everything we got,
          but this may be much of an issue to begin with.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a viewer/fan, I understand what you all do to support your favorite
          streamers, and that it’s very disheartening to see them deal with
          circumstances such as getting banned or deplatformed. Regardless of whether or
          not a streamer is associated with many categories such as 18+ and variety, our
          role remains the same: To connect ourselves with the streamers and the rest of
          the community. But oftentimes, we give in to temptations and pass it along to
          the streamers in order to cater to our needs and wants -- and some of us are
          quite okay with it, regardless of how extreme this is. But sometimes, we can’t
          be certain if what we want is acceptable across the wide audience. Sure, some
          can be alright with certain factors, but we also need to consider the wider
          community at large. Are we doing things that satisfy other members of our
          community? Or are we just doing things just to satisfy ourselves?
        </p>
        <p>
          As a platform, I’m deeply in shock at how we enforce rules and update them
          when necessary. As a platform, we aim to serve a wide variety of audiences
          through many form factors; but sometimes, there are still some that went under
          the radar. I understand the need to cater most audiences after much debate,
          but we still need to do better in predicting what would happen if we enforce
          certain rules and not just to settle the debate. Let’s understand that as a
          platform, we cater to internet-legal-aged audiences, and we’re not just
          another platform only to host such content as discussed above. Every platform
          has its own designated content categories, but as a public platform, let’s aim
          to keep it that way so that everyone can join in without any problems.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
          What can we do as a streamer, as a viewer/fan, and as a platform?
        </strong></p>
        <p>
          It’s simple: <strong>We need to hold ourselves accountable for what we did and
          how we impact others.</strong>
          It’s time for us to finally realize what we’ve done and how we should make up
          for it other than just apologizing. We need to better ourselves for the better
          of our community. Always be mindful of our actions and how they impact the
          larger groups. And most importantly, let ourselves be subjected to good
          criticisms -- criticisms that can impact us in a positive way. Lend our ears
          to the community and not treat them like ignorant fools. We care for our
          community as much as they care for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, let’s not become strictly just another wave of degenerates. We have
          platforms that cater to such desires, let’s not just straight-up put it in
          another platform and expect it to just sit there. Let it be known that we must
          not act like that one streamer named godeugenes, who made headlines because of
          an obviously-inappropriate content that changed the course of Twitch.
