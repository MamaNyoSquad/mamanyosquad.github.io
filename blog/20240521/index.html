      <p>
        We&#39;re undergoing a major shift in how we present the website going
        forward. The G.Mgr gives us the following updates on the situation, as well as
        in other areas.

        <h2 id="sec1">Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>thebelovedmoon, G.Mgr of #MamaNyoSquad.</strong></p>
        <p>
          These past few weeks have been a very hectic experience with regards to
          multitasking and a lot of stuff -- especially when it comes to VTubing
          activities. Despite that, though, I remain committed to my other works;
          especially this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;ve given it some thought about what would be the future of the Squad and
          its underlying framework, and I&#39;m excited to share you the next steps in
          order to [hopefully] make use of this platform even more.
        </p>
        <h2 id="sec2">Website Design</h2>
        <p>
          Recently, I&#39;ve taken on a new task of trying to update the website&#39;s
          design language, seeing as I&#39;m already making progress in the other
          projects that I had on my disposal. One of them happened to be my own website
          <code>thebelovedmoon.github.io</code>, where I attempt to update its design
          following the 2024 framework for my VTubing activities. (It&#39;s worth noting
          that I&#39;ve gone the route similar to the Marias&#39; design language for a
          unified experience at large, and have it integrated with the others while
          I&#39;m at it.)
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, I&#39;ve set out to improve my other web projects with
          their intended design languages, so it will take a while for them to actually
          work. Same goes for this project, which has been the start of my web building
          journey since being booted off from Bookmark back in April 2022. (Read the
          <a href="/20220413">open letter</a> to see what I mean.) It had gone through
          several iterations that I had to separate them into different classifications:
          Pre-Overhaul and Post-Overhaul.
          <strong>This time, it&#39;ll be much different.</strong>
        </p>
        <h2 id="sec3"><code>mamanyosquad-preview</code></h2>
        <p>
          Now a lot of you who have a keen eye have noticed that I have provisioned a
          new repository on our GitHub Organizations page. The main reason I want to
          deal with this is that I&#39;ll be drafting what will be the new look of the
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, it will provide a &quot;unified&quot; design language that
          encompasses what I&#39;ve learned from all attempts at web development --
          seeing that I&#39;ve made some progress in my other projects, with others
          currently in the works.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consequently, some elements will be migrated over to the new framework; so I
          have to do some trial-and-error in order to get it to work seamlessly when the
          time comes that it&#39;ll be forwarded to upstream.
        </p>
        <button class="NyoBtn" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/MamaNyoSquad/mamanyosquad-preview')">Check out the repository</button>
        <h3>What makes it different from the main repository?</h3>
        <p>
          <code>mamanyosquad-preview</code> is split into different branches which
          encompasses different iterations (called versions) of the website we&#39;re
          currently working on (not just my own). In essence, it will be useful when
          there are events that will take place on this platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to accompany such results, we&#39;ve provisioned two underlying
          technologies to make this work: <strong>GitHub Codespaces</strong> and
          <strong>Nginx</strong>! Thanks to these technologies, we the SquadMates (and
          fellow frontend developers who want to contribute to these iterations) will be
          able to preview the changes seamlessly from a codespace dedicated to each
          branch! (I&#39;ll be providing the proper documentation once things settle
          down in order to get started with the codespace.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite everything, we&#39;re still using the same licensing metadata from
          upstream (MIT and CC-BY-4.0).
        </p>
        <h3>NEW: Web Versioning</h3>
        <p>
          As stipulated above, we&#39;ll be utilizing our web versioning in order to
          identify which branch of <code>mamanyosquad-preview</code> is actively being
          used on upstream (AKA this website). We&#39;ll be using the versioning
          format <code>branchname.xx.yy</code>, where:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>branchname</code> refers to the branch being used on upstream,
              usually denoted in YYYYMMDD format
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>xx</code> refers to any major version (any commit that has the
              <strong>MAJOR</strong> tag in upstream&#39;s PR)
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>yy</code> refers to any minor version (any commit that has the
              <strong>MINOR</strong> tag in upstream&#39;s PR)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are rules that encompass how this format works, which will be made
          available in the Preview&#39;s documentation.
        </p>
        <h3>Wait -- what will happen to the current iteration?</h3>
        <p>
          Don&#39;t worry -- while the current upstream will be overwritten any time
          soon, its underlying code can still be accessible via the Commits page; and
          its framework will be migrated over to Preview following its base versioning
          format!
        </p>
        <h2 id="sec4">#MamaNyoSquad Publishing</h2>
        <p>
          #MamaNyoSquad Publishing will have its own dedicated repository in the coming
          weeks/months in order to identify itself away from upstream&#39;s framework,
          which means it will have its own set that will accommodate the readers through
          its published works. Through the power of the Progressive Web App (PWA),
          readers can enjoy streamlined experience whether they are on Mobile or
          Desktops.
        </p>
        <p>
          With regards to its publications, they will be re-evaluated for any possible
          spelling-and-grammar errors to be easily readable when they return to the
          website. It should be noted that starting from &quot;Romantic Perception&quot;
          (Inside Story no.6), all publications will stay on the website as to migrate
          away from newsletters following Revue&#39;s shutdown on 18 Jan 2023.
        </p>
        <h3>Empty - Helena's Inside Story Pt.2</h3>
        <p>
          On a related note, I&#39;m proud to declare that the Inside Story no.7 --
          titled &quot;Empty&quot; -- is done as of 20 May! I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s
          been more than TWO YEARS since I first provisioned this story as the newest
          addition to the Inside Story lineup, which was bombarded with uncertainties
          following my venture as a VTuber. But since I loved DOAXVV to the core and
          wanted to thrive more than I should, I still pushed through and finally
          completed it against all odds!
        </p>
        <p>You can access this Inside Story (and the others) via the button below:</p>
        <button class="NyoBtn" onclick="window.open('https://bit.ly/VIDiariesInsideStory')">Inside Stories (Docs Format)</button>
        <h3>What about <code>vidiaries-app</code>?</h3>
        <p>
          Upon realizing the existence of PWAs, <strong>I had to make a difficult
          decision to retire the said repository.</strong> Another reason for such a
          retirement is that it puts much strain on developing apps via the Android
          Studio platform where it may be uncertain to be compatible with other
          platforms, like iOS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The importance at this current state is to ensure cross-compatibility with all
          devices regardless of operating systems and device specifications, which is
          currently possible with PWA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don&#39;t worry -- the archival of the repository is still ways off in
          expectations that some web elements dependent on it may break, so it&#39;ll
          give me more time to polish the final preview release (with migrated URLs).
          I&#39;ll send over the archival state in the foreseeable future.
        </p>
        <h2 id="sec5">Regarding the X Platform...</h2>
        <p>
          We just oversaw the change that may be drastic in the long run:
          <strong
            ><code>twitter.com</code> has been officially renamed to
            <code>x.com</code>.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          First off, we&#39;ve been focusing on the website&#39;s R&amp;D that we
          haven&#39;t updated much on the X Platform (formerly Twitter). However, we
          have some minor updates that we may consider in the long run:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Updating of profile graphics (mostly accommodating the 96 DPI standard)
            </li>
            <li>
              Promotional graphics using publicly-available assets from DOAXVV PR
              (mostly Global)
            </li>
            <li>
              Updated birthday greetings for Venuses and their Seiyuus (Nyotengu and
              Satou Akemi take priority)
            </li>
            <li>Maintenance Routine deliveries</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, we&#39;ll be utilizing our X account like what we used to before:
          Engaging in events like DOAXVV Event Showcases and Community Events. However,
          the latter may be still in questioning as to not cause an upheaval within our
          communities because of the SquadMates&#39; past infractions; so we&#39;ll be
          careful in conducting such events moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, our presence on X in relation to our website is hindered by our
          non-option to the platform&#39;s Premium services. In turn, we just noticed
          that our Embedded Timelines are not showing in contrast to
          @doax_vv_staff&#39;s (since the latter is opted to such). We might invest in
          Premium Services (starting from base Premium, not Basic) in order to restore
          the Embedded Timelines service in a foreseeable future, but it comes at a cost
          of our expenses. We&#39;ll let you know in the coming moments via subsequent
          posts on X or blogs here on this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourth, in order to conform to the domain change as stated above, the
          <code>widgets.js</code> has been modified -- replacing &quot;twitter&quot;
          with &quot;X&quot;. Most of the functions/classes remain unchanged, however,
          as to not break the appearance of X Embedded Web services. We might opt to
          restore the original format whenever we see fit or otherwise pursuant to our
          legal implications outlined in our Policies.
        </p>
        <h2 id="sec6">So... what's next?!</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we got the necessary info out, what&#39;s really next for
          #MamaNyoSquad? Honestly, it&#39;s still ways off until it can be described as
          one of the ultimate DEAD OR ALIVE platforms to have ever existed. We still
          have some more features being baked in the oven, but at least we get to see
          what&#39;s going to be the next big thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;m honestly looking forward to improving this website even more to
          accommodate more viewers and continue waving the flag -- bringing the essence
          of the series through DOAXVV and beyond!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now with more projects related to this one under my belt, I might need some
          more all-nighters to complete these at once (lol jk); but I hope that you
          enjoy reading this Blog nonetheless! Again, we&#39;ll be providing updates
          related to the website and our workflows where applicable.
