      <h1>An Open Letter to Bookmark</h1>
      <em>published 13 April 2022 UTC</em><br>
      <em>updated 20 February 2024 UTC</em>
      <p>
        This is a copy of the Open Letter that was originally published on our
        Bookmark&#39;s counterpart before it signed off following the restriction of
        their service models. As of 20 February 2024, its web presence has been shut
        down indefinitely.

        <p>
          We, whom have been your loyal customers on the platform, are saddened by the
          sudden concurrent changes that has affected our workflows. It has been such a
          pain to be able to maintain our social presence across the Internet without
          worrying when our features are going to be limited anytime soon. And most
          importantly, we&#39;re in a deep worry that due to the new pricing guidelines,
          our free websites--like this one--is bound to be deleted soon. (we&#39;ve made
          backups of it just in case, so that we won&#39;t lose any hard work, but
          nonetheless.)
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, we&#39;ve been staying on this platform for many months (if not a
          year or two), freely customizing our websites as we wish without any worry of
          limitations. we&#39;ve been so grateful to be provided many new features that
          will enhance the website experience, but that came at a cost: We need to pay
          to utilize the advanced services and keep our websites active.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we understand that these paid services are the &#39;keys&#39; to
          improving the site experience, but please understand that some customers of
          this platform can&#39;t stay longer because when their &quot;Free Trial&quot;
          ends, they MUST PAY to continue using the service; whereas themselves have a
          tight budget or have no budget at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of these sudden changes, those who are in that sector have a choice to
          pay up to continue using the basic services after the trial, or remove from
          the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we move on, we just wanted to mention that restricting customizations
          is a real pain considering that some websites have individual customization
          settings before this sudden change, like in Emmannuel&#39;s case, in which he
          <a
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            href="https://x.com/i/status/1513791911919644675"
            target="_blank"
            >tweeted</a
          >
          at 8:11am UTC. In a nutshell, the websites after this update have restricted
          the customizations (like header and footer) to apply globally. What&#39;s
          worse is that unlike the last update [as we can remember] that you limited our
          free websites to 5, you haven&#39;t pushed future updates to your customers,
          which proves that the changes are sudden without their notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&#39;re appealing to Bookmark to reconsider other options considering the
          no-budget customers like us and features that we deem are demanding to be
          returned, amongst other considerations not mentioned in this open letter.
