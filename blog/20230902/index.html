          Our Social & Web Manager has this official statement regarding the shutdown of SINoALICE Global, the game
          that has been a part of him since 2020. 
        </p>
        <div class="inThisArticle"></div>
        <div class="secContain">
          <p>
            This is <b>Emmannuel Ortega</b>, Social & Web Manager for #MamaNyoSquad.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been a part of the SINoALICE universe since its inception on July 2020, and since then I have been
            committed to enriching its experience through my expertise. This game have been a major factor in bringing
            the universes together for a never-ending desire, something that I have been looking forward to since its
            inception.
          </p>
          <p>
            It began when one of the closest people I associate myself with has introduced me to it, and she has ushered
            her own efforts along with it. That gave me an interest in trying that out, and soon I became hooked on to
            it. Although we could not talk about it anymore since she has since been disappeared without a trace.
            However, her spirit will always linger with me and I will continue her journey through countless efforts
            and determination through this game.
          </p>
          <p><i>
            And in addition, she became one of what I call the Circles, something that I will be cherishing for
            generations to come. That is why I founded the <b>「Seal of the Circle (SotC)」</b> to repay my gratitude
            towards two of the people whom I associate with, that I loved deeply in my heart.
          </i></p>
          <p>
            My story had become livelier when I realized one of the characters in the game—Snow White—perfectly fits my
            vision of taking matters with prejudice and consideration, where impartiality becomes the basis for a
            rational approach to every situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I vowed, moving forward, that I will represent as the endeared Symbol of Justice.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my experience with SINoALICE, I have a Guild named 「TheLonelyBride」, which initially was attributed
            to one of the Classes associated with Snow White; specifically the Cleric class, where she endowed herself
            in an alternative revision of a wedding dress. However, that has changed when she debuted later in her Mage
            class—something that shocked the community as she endowed in an elegant <i>*literal*</i> wedding dress itself.
            This, complete with a stamp titled 「Snow White/Bride」, has made me stuck upon for the remainder of my
            experiences as a whole, while becoming as one of the Players who represent Snow White.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those experiences, among other instances that I did not mention in this Message, are what I will be taking
            with when the Global Edition finally seals the Library into a halt. The memories and experiences I had with it
            became a foundation that will be inherited by the ideas that I will populate in its honor.
          </p>
          <p>
            To every Guild that I have fought a battle on in the Colosseum, to every Player whom I had a co-op battle with,
            to everyone who have stuck with the community to its final breath, I thank you for your never-ending commitment
            in harnessing the stories from within.
          </p>
          <p>
            To SQUARE ENIX and Pokelabo: Without both of your efforts, SINoALICE would not have been possible. Your
            commitment to ensuring quality on your game has been one of the biggest factors in which I loved, and I hope
            that will carry on with your future endeavors. ありがとうございます。
          </p>
          <p>
            To those who have read to the very end of this Message, I hope you can support SINoALICE Global to the very end.
            You can find them on Twitter / X at <b>@sinoaliceglobal</b>, or play the game along with me to the end. <b>Let us
            wander around the Library for the final time.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            And, before I can conclude this Message: <b>I will not be going anywhere.</b> As soon as Pokelabo pulls the plug
            on Global Edition, I will be around on the Japanese Edition. So, you can expect the same experiences as it would
            during my first experiences on the former.
          </p>
