      <h3>Nagisa's Inside Story</h3>
      <em>Published 7 September 2021</em>
      <p>Nagisa blatantly expresses her desire of disgust the first time she came to the Venus Island, to try and convince her
        sister to leave immediately. Albeit apologized for what she did, it did come to the conclusion that her constant
        arrogance over the course became the grounds for some... rather bad events. Could the new Ona-san help her with her
        situation and put an end to her constant despair?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <b>POV: Owner</b>
        <br><br>
        As the morning sun shines over the Venus Island on an early Sunday, I was about to distribute some of my finest homemade
        coffee to the girls when I saw Nagisa looking at the ocean, sighing in defeat. It’s been a year since I finally came back
        here after a four-year break from what might’ve been my greatest demise. I have already given Misaki her sweet coffee
        prior to this.
        <br><br>
        Nevertheless, I proceed to serve her first, when she slowly looks up to me with a subtle frown on her face. “I suppose
        things have been really hard when you’re gone,” she said in a subtle tone. She adds, “I can’t help but feel sorry for
        myself. I just... can’t.”
        <br><br>
        I nod, patting her shoulder. “You’ll be okay. I’ll just need to give these to the others first, then we’ll talk about
        what’s on your mind.”
        <br><br>
        I was about to turn my back when she reached for my hand, stopping me in my tracks, a gentle smile on her face. “Hey...
        when you’re done, come see me at the café. I was about to help my sister, anyway.”
        <br><br>
        “Sure,” I responded, returning to my coffee duty.
        <br><br>
        <i>A few minutes later...</i>
        <br><br>
        Approaching the café where Misaki and Nagisa--the sisters--were working, I set off to one of the tables where I can sip
        my own coffee blend with Jasmine and Aloe. It was the same blend that I gave to Helena, even on the other day.
        <br><br>
        Anyway, I was about to take my first sip when I heard Nagisa calling up to me. I approach, telling her what’s up. The
        next batch of conversations made me feel sad for some reason.
        <br><br>
        “I was actually thinking, do you... perhaps in ample situations... feel sad when you lose someone you thought was gonna
        help you in the long run because of the stupidity you made against them?”
        <br><br>
        “I don’t know. Why’d you ask?”
        <br><br>
        “I guess...” She takes a long sigh. “That’s what happened to me. I mean, by a lot.”
        <br><br>
        “Well, I can see that,” I sat down. “There’s probably a bunch of people who already dislike you for being Misaki’s sister
        because of your behavior.”
        <br><br>
        “It was, and I feel really bad about it,” she sighs in defeat. “I was just trying to protect my sister... and presumably
        the others. That carried over to this island with the former Owner whom I disliked a bit too much... that I can’t help
        myself.”
        <br><br>
        “I know he’s a jerk sometimes,” Misaki adds, sitting down beside her. “But we all like him because he cared for us... 
        ntil, well, that happened.”
        <br><br>
        Nagisa nods slowly, continuing her story. “Although apologizing to him seems to cool things off for me, it didn’t take
        too long to realize that I might be a bit too late to reflect upon my actions afterwards. I guess you know what happened
        next.”
        <br><br>
        “Yeah... You did everything in your book to try to get him off your sister, to the point that he became distressed.
        What’s worse is that you’ve gone over-the-top by telling him to leave the island at once, or else you’ll... kill him?”
        <br><br>
        She nods, tears falling from her eyes. “Yes,” she sniffs, about to cry.
        <br><br>
        “But why would you do that to him, then? I mean- I’m pretty sure there’s a reason why,” I said, trying to calm her down.
        <br><br>
        “We... had an argument. I don’t know what it is, but I think because he chose my sister over me? I don’t even think he’d
        come to that conclusion!”
        <br><br>
        “Which means your vague assumptions got in the way?”
        <br><br>
        “Yes, and I feel terrible saying that while slapping his face...” She breaks down, becoming more feeble. “I- I just...
        can’t help myself... and did that. I’m just shameless, and I need to be punished for this.”
        <br><br>
        While hearing those words from her mouth, my heart became a little moved. Surely, she didn’t do that because her past got
        in the way, did she? Or is there something odd that’s making her feel like this?
        <br><br>
        I wonder.
        <br><br>
        “I’ll take her to the Suite and try to calm her down. I’ll call you when she’s ready to talk with you.” Misaki decides,
        helping her grieving sister get inside the mansion.
        <br><br>
        Thinking about what happened, I try to find Helena if she has connections with Nagisa prior to those incidents. “We did
        have some activities before, including some heart-to-heart talks. I could see in her eyes that time that she was really
        disgusted by his pervasive actions, but to me, regardless of him being a pervert or not, I highly believe he means well.
        I mean, we wouldn’t be here in the first place if it weren’t for him,” she said, sighing.
        <br><br>
        “Perversion accusation, hm?” I scratch my head.
        <br><br>
        “She does that all the time, I’m afraid,” she crosses her arms, looking at the ocean. “I can’t believe that it carried
        over when you came here as well.”
        <br><br>
        “I know.”
        <br><br>
        “In that case,” Helena holds my hand, heading us back to the café. “I should tell you some important events in which her
        arrogance got too far. We even got to talk about it before things got... worse.”
        <br><br>
        “Alright,” I said, lending my ear.
        <br><br>
        She sighs deeply. “Here it is... There’s one point that she was annoyed at Fiona for being too close to Ona-san (the
        previous). It was evident that she not only wants to protect her sister from his "indecisive actions", but she wants to
        protect us girls from him. When asked about it one-on-one, she just meant that she doesn’t like his sorts of actions
        towards the girls. I think it’s because when things stabilize, we might open this island for tourists in the future? I’m
        not really sure.”
        <br><br>
        I nod. I kinda want to do the same thing, though I had another island I could make a purpose of.
        <br><br>
        “Another one was when Misaki asked him about special gifts for Christmas. Although he planned on prioritizing Nagisa
        first, her sister insisted. Things got a little heated when she kissed him on the nose. I’m not quite sure what it meant,
        and when she and Misaki met inside, slaps ensued in the room. I tried to ask them about it, but they declined. Then I
        asked him what’s up with them, and why did she do that... to the point that he told me that he gave her a special ring.
        At this point, he said, he really tried.”
        <br><br>
        “Hold on- the ring? How does that correlate to the slaps?”
        <br><br>
        “You see, I talked to him a little more, and he admitted that he did have some... distinct feelings for Nagisa in the
        process. As for her, she told me the other night before that incident that she's willing to give it her all to convince
        him to be engaged with her and put an end to this rivalry. Pretty weird for a common arrogant girl her age.”
        <br><br>
        “I can see that,” I said, sighing as I heard more cries as I looked up from the Suite balcony. From the looks of it,
        Misaki is desperately trying to calm her sister down, but Nagisa's continuous sobbing makes it useless.
        <br><br>
        “Things eventually got worse when the two met up in private. Instead of trying to sort things out, she did everything in
        the book to try and boot him off once again. But this time, not only did her plan work, it also caused significant
        emotional problems for others relying on him in the long run, like I did back then. Only a bit occasionally, though.”
        <br><br>
        “You mean, when Marie told Sayuri and Fiona about what happened?”
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, and then months later, she almost put the blame on me because of what happened to her by attacking me head-on. At
        this point, I started to become very upset. I’m not the one that tells everyone about what I know after I get in touch
        with somebody,” she sighs heavily.
        <br><br>
        I pat her left shoulder. “It's okay... even I struggled with that before I came here, too. But regardless, this shouldn’t
        have gone too far if she weren’t that arrogant to herself, yeah?”
        <br><br>
        “Absolutely,” she nods.
        <br><br>
        Just in time for Fiona to approach us two, facing my direction. “Misaki wants you at the Suite immediately.”
        <br><br>
        I nod, waving Helena goodbye. “I guess I have to talk to you some other time, Helen.”
        <br><br>
        She smiles, waving back as I leave. “Don’t worry! Please come anytime!”
        <br><br>
        As I make my way through the Suite door, it immediately opens with Misaki bearing a depressed look on her face. “I tried,
        but I can’t.”
        <br><br>
        I slowly nod, facing Fiona’s direction. “Please take care of her immediately. I’ll handle her sister.”
        <br><br>
        “Will do, Ona-sama,” she said, proceeding to help Misaki get down the stairs as I head inside, finding Nagisa perching on
        the bed with her head slumped between her legs.
        <br><br>
        “I’ve been very terrible...” She shudders, her body still feeble. I slowly approach her side to try and console her with
        the best I can. Slowly, she looks at me, and immediately pulls me into an embrace.
        <br><br>
        I gently pat her back, telling her that everything’s gonna be okay. She seems to relieve for a bit, but her soft sob still
        makes me concerned about what she might do later on.
        <br><br>
        Pulling from the embrace, she slowly cups my cheeks, a little tear flowing down her face, sighing deeply between her bosom.
        “I guess I should tell you the full story of what happened. It’s best to let it out other than hiding and be guilty about
        it. It’s... probably for the best, anyway.”
        <br><br>
        I slowly nod, tending to her teardrops as I wipe them off her cheeks.
        <br><br>
        She chuckles for a bit, looking down as she frowns. A small pause ensues as she prepares herself to tell her life story for
        the very first time.
        <br><br>
        “When we were very young, I was always the one taking care of her since our parents were away on most days of the week. In
        those times, I was the one who’s considered to be strict towards her, especially when she chooses what type of personality
        she will have. Oftentimes, I became so strict that I was always punished for that. All I just did was to ensure that she
        will become a proper woman when the time comes. As time went by, I started getting involved in fights. And in certain
        conditions, I was badly hurt because of it. It didn’t take long for her to realize that what I did was just to keep her
        safe.”
        <br><br>
        My gaze became more focused on her sorrowful look as she continued to share her story, slowly noticing that she began to
        break down, her body almost unable to move from the amount of sorrow that she had.
        <br><br>
        “What’s even worse, is that I was heavily criticized to the point that I don’t wanna attend school. I don’t deserve to be
        her sister, one said. Others even got the chance to talk to Misaki to remind her that I’m the worst friend that they had. 
        I... I know it’s exaggerating, but...”
        <br><br>
        Slowly breaking loose, she slumps to the foam, more tears coming from her eyes. I can’t help but lean her back against my
        chest, letting her calm down for a bit.
        <br><br>
        ...
        <br><br>
        Nagisa holds my hand as firmly as she can. “You know, there are some events that you wished would never happen. I definitely
        fall under this category since I had the worst so far. I hope you can understand.”
        <br><br>
        “It’s okay,” I said. “Everybody has their ups and downs... even I had my experience with it, too. And in your case, I think
        it’s safe to say that that can happen to anyone.”
        <br><br>
        She slowly shakes her head a no. “It’s far worse. And I’ll tell you why: Back when I was just a member of a theater troupe
        in Japan, I already had developed intense hostility towards Ona-san (the previous). In short, I became very upset because I
        initially thought that my sister was being photographed for pervasive purposes, although it’s completely the opposite. I let
        out my rage at him the time I made my way here, that the following moments were just no conversations... aside from being
        taken for Venus Festivals, per se.”
        <br><br>
        She adds, “It was at this point that I learned that despite his pervasiveness, he still tries his best to take care of me and
        the rest. I have to admit for the first time: I had a soft spot for him, and I’m trying to express my feelings for him.”
        <br><br>
        “But deep inside, I know that if I don’t let up my rage, I’m just gonna do it over and over again, until I’m completely locked
        out of everyone’s zone. Yes, I’ve gotten pretty close to him, but this still doesn’t change the way I act towards him to most
        extent. Didn’t I mention that I’ve completely gone over-the-top as well?”
        <br><br>
        “Yeah... about that,” I softly brush her hair, calming her down this time. Just before I could supply another sentence, she
        slowly turned around to cup my cheeks.
        <br><br>
        “Listen... I only did this because I know I’ve put so much trust in him. I don’t want others to get involved when I get the
        chance to express my feelings when the time comes. Things got... much worse.”
        <br><br>
        At this point, I was unsure on what to respond to next, considering that she already had the worst decision she could ever come
        up with.
        <br><br>
        “I just can’t... I can’t do this anymore...” Nagisa cries, wrapping my arms around her back as she pulls her body closer, her
        voice slowly fainting.
        <br><br>
        “I need help...”
        <br><br>
        <i>That evening...</i>
        <br><br>
        All the girls are here at the open grounds as I approach the podium, Misaki following behind me. Minutes ago, I reassured
        Nagisa of her emotional stability before I set off from the Suite where she’s currently at.
        <br><br>
        As I’m about to perch closer to the mic, I reassure first that the girls are ready to listen. And thus I begin my speech for
        the night:
        <br><br>
        “Girls, we all know how hard life was for us during those past years. We’ve been struggling to get back on our feet, and
        succeeded with triumph. Unfortunately for Nagisa, her story is much different than some of yours. She lived through a harsh life
        just for the sake of protecting and taking care of her sister. She even got into fights, and worse, had much hatred towards a
        few. One of them is the predecessor before me, whom despite the tribulations she caused, he struggled to make things right...
        until the worst came to his life, leaving everything he had ultimately worked for behind. Though most of you might think that it
        was her fault after all, let’s just take a deep breath and say to ourselves that this can happen to anybody.”
        <br><br>
        I pause for a moment, sighing. “We can forgive and try to forget, but if we don’t change within ourselves, history will repeat
        itself over and over again... until we don’t have any forgiveness left in our heart. And we don’t wanna let hatred succumb us
        into darkness, either.”
        <br><br>
        In the middle of the speech, I just noticed that Nagisa slowly gets out of the mansion just to see me talk. Could she hear about
        my potential plans to uplift her spirits and emotion?
        <br><br>
        “So I say this: Tomorrow, we’re going to do whatever we can to try and convince Nagisa to change her ways. Act kind towards her,
        be friends with her, whatever you choose. Be positive at all times, and let your difficulties out. We’ll have to let her know that
        despite everything that she had in the past up to the point of no return, she is loved and cared for by everyone... and that
        includes ourselves.”
        <br><br>
        They simultaneously nod to the notion, Fiona raising her hand. “Yes?” I ask.
        <br><br>
        “Um, since I have connections with her during my time here, would it be possible for me to lead through this initiative?”
        <br><br>
        “Very well, Fiona. You and Misaki go quite well for this operation, since you both were close to each other as well,” I exclaim,
        looking behind to see Misaki giving me a thumbs-up. I smile as a reply.
        <br><br>
        Little did I know that Helena was looking at the mansion door to see Nagisa leaning her back, sighing. Approaching the podium,
        Helena wants to lend my ear because of what she discovered.
        <br><br>
        “So she apparently knows it already,” I reply. “I wonder what she would do about it next.”
        <br><br>
        “I could only wonder,” Helena said, returning back to her seat, which is close to Nyotengu for whatever reason.
        <br><br>
        Closing it off for the night, I give my last regards: “With that said, I hope everyone is ready for tomorrow. I’ll speak to Nagisa
        about this, and if things develop, she’ll be able to change her ways in the long run. That concludes for the night.”
        <br><br>
        As I hand over some papers to Misaki, I head inside the mansion first, with Nagisa following me back to the Suite where I’ll be
        sleeping for the night.
        <br><br>
        Upon closing the door, she immediately hugs me from behind, her face bestowing a soft smile. “Thanks for doing this... I’ll promise
        to be good to you and everyone and be in good hands in the end from now on.”
        <br><br>
        “I know,” I firmly held her hand. “I’m not doing this because I want you to be good, I’m doing this because I want you to feel loved.
        After everything that you suffered, I think it’s time for you to be happy like you wanted to.”
        <br><br>
        The next few days were almost the same. Nagisa felt some arrogance, but not to the point that she’s deeply enraged. Fiona and Misaki
        did a great job at keeping her well, with her emotional status improving over time. By night, she decided to sleep with me for the
        rest of the month, along with a promise to take me out to somewhere she might think I’ll love.
        <br><br>
        Upon looking back at the biography book a month later, I decide to write the following words on a sticky note on Nagisa’s page:
        <br><br>
        <div class="journalWrite">
          <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> Her emotions seem to be improving as we go along. Our continuous
          effort to try and make her happy again feels nothing more than special. I hope this continues as we march towards the
          new future of the renowned Venus Island.
