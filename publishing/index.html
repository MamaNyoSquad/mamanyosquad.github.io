                  <h1>The Inside Story Series</h1>
                  <p>
                    #MamaNyoSquad Publishing started off as a collection of stories from various Venuses who have
                    their own story to tell as they make their stay at the Venus Island.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stories full of drama, mystery, and hope -- all resides here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since its first Inside story, its writing technique has evolved over time -- making it the root
                    of what the Main Story is today.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    #MamaNyoSquad Publishing is a collective mind -- resembling the experiences of the Venuses and
                    alike.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At its core, is the representation that will always be bound through space and time. The chemistry
                    between its prominent characters -- Main and Sub (Nyotengu and Helena) -- became the footprint of
                    how this brand came to be: All sides, all universal in their own right.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Correlating to Venus Island Diaries, they play the biggest role in redefining the history of the
                    island by representing themselves.

                  <b>thebelovedmoon</b> is the General Manager of #MamaNyoSquad, and the main author behind #MamaNyoSquad
                  Publishing. His current focus in terms of this caliber is Venus Island Diaries, as he spent his time to
                  reinvent the story through its experiences as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While not on his duty as G.Mgr, he's the man of many sorts -- Graphic Designer (PowerPoint), Composer,
                  Gamer, PR Manager, and Resident VTuber Supporter!
                </p>
                <p>
                  You may know him for instances such as ReactSquad (home of ReactOS-PH and ReactOS Italia), Princess
                  Connect! Re:Dive (as Mana Senri), or VTubers such as the most-notable Hina Oujo as one of the Community
                  Moderators.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His interest in writing first stemmed from his experience in DEAD OR ALIVE Xtreme Venus Vacation (DOAXVV)
                  and his analysis on its Episodes. When all of his ideas came to light, he made the decision to put everything
                  to execution -- making its initial mark as Venus Island Diaries through its first Inside Story named "Deep
                  Arrogance - Nagisa's Inside Story". That and many others that came after that became the inspiration for the
                  first rendition of its Main Story. He then since rewrote the story last April 2022 since his writing style
                  has evolved a lot with every proceeding Inside Stories. Since then, he devoted his whole writing career to
                  finishing the Main Story in a few years since its rewrite.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He's also working on two other stories not aligned with the Publishing: <b>Life after Mahotan ～ まほたん後の人生 ～</b>
                  (under tbm publishing co.) and <b>346: Scourge</b> (under Sumiyoi Publisher's Pact).
