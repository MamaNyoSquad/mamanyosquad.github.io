      <h1>Our approach to migrating our Inside Stories</h1>
      <p>
        We had our first Inside Story -- <b>Deep Arrogance</b> -- migrated to the website due to the shutdown
        of Revue. This has been improved, alongside the addition of existing Inside Stories into the migration
        phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our primary focus on this approach is to make it mobile-friendly since we'll be including them in the
        app.
      </p>
      <p>
        All contents are taken from their original Google Docs files, along with some minor spelling, grammar
        and formatting adjustments. We've also included effects not present in the Docs for a more immersive
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Desktop and Web users, you can still view the documents as they would on mobile via
        <code>https://mamanyosquad.github.io/publishing</code>.

      <h1>Improvements to our ImageView implementation</h1>
      <p>
        We've done a bit of research on how we can implement a better way to display our images without
        sacrificing the APK size. We came across an article by GeeksforGeeks about how we can appeal to such
        implementation, and safely delete the image resources in our project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Albeit a bit slow to load, the <code>ImageView</code> components rendered successfully!
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who want to take a look at the implementations that we base on, head over to the Releases
        page via the FAB on the bottom-right and look for <b>v0.3.6-prerelease</b> on the release title.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="fillWidth card">
      <h1>Some adjustments to <code>build.gradle.kts</code></h1>
      <p>
        We've done a bit of coding work to be able to prepare ourselves whenever we finally push the official
        <code>v1.0-release</code> version of the app! For transparency, we provided the following code as shown
        below:
      </p>
      <pre>
        buildTypes {
          named("release") {
            isMinifyEnabled = true
            isShrinkResources = true
            setProguardFiles(listOf(getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"), "proguard-rules.pro"))
            <b>versionNameSuffix = "-release"</b>
          }
          named("debug") {
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("debug")
            <b>versionNameSuffix = "-prerelease"</b>
          }
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        <i>Note that the new versioning implementation is denoted in bold text in the <code>pre</code> block.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving forward with this approach, all future <code>-prerelease</code>s will be published under the "debug"
        option, while <code>-release</code> will be under the "release" option.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the full code, head over to <code>vidiaries-app/app/build.gradle.kts</code> under the
        <code>development</code> branch, with more details under the hood. Keep on reading for future implementation
        notes.
      </p>

      <h1>Multiple Kotlin files, one <code>WebView</code></h1>
      <p>
        As we continue to expand our migration phase in the middle of development from <code>v0.3.5-prerelease</code>
        to <code>v0.3.6-prerelease</code>, we tried many ways to get pages going on one <code>WebView</code>. The best
        implementation that we can proceed with is to invoke multiple Kotlin files bearing the respective Inside Story
        releases in each file, and direct the said files to a <code>WebView</code> layout XML.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to take a look at the implementations that we did, head over to
        <code>vidiaries-app/app/src/main/java/mamanyosquad/vidiaries</code> directory under the <code>development</code>
        branch.

      <h1>Making site-wide changes</h1>
      <p>
        As part of the redesign efforts, we'll begin improving the <code>publishing</code> page on a regular basis. This
        release note covers the following adjustments:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Changes to our FAB (Floating Action Button), and optimizing it against unnecessary attributes</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This also affects the <code>publishing</code> page, where it employs the same FAB implementation</li>
        </ul>
        <li><code>.fillWidth</code> blocks are more blog-like, similar to the Inside Story pages</li>
        <li>Inside Story pages have splash screens implemented</li>
        <ul>
          <li>For more information, visit <code>thebelovedmoon.github.io</code>'s sourcecode on GitHub</li>
        </ul>

    <br>
    <div class="fillWidth card">
      <h1>Adjustments to <code>build.gradle.kts</code></h1>
      <p>
        We're working on optimizing the experience without sacrificing the APK size even more! In a future pre-release,
        all implementations that we employed on our "release" option will carry over to "debug".
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="fillWidth card">
      <h1>Tablet view</h1>
      <p>
        Once we're done with all of the optimizations as we work on more adjustments in the app, we'll make the app
        tablet-friendly by invoking the <b>Tablet View Layout XML</b>, usable for larger screens and foldables.
