        <h3>Tsukushi’s Inside Story</h3>
        <em>Published 31 October 2021</em>
        <p>
          Following the party is the secret a former tourist doesn’t want to expose. But how will her secrecy be revealed to the new
          Owner as they go?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>POV: Owner</b>
          <br><br>
          I slowly take her hand and slowly we proceed to the centerstage, preparing for our dance. As the slow music started playing,
          her eyes lit up wide. “It’s the same song that I heard for a long time,” she said, clinging onto my shoulders.
          <br><br>
          As we continue to dance, Tsukushi starts to sing the chorus; while Misaki, Momiji, and Helena follow suit. The rest of the
          girls clap to the beat.
          <br><br>
          “I couldn’t have been happier,” Fiona exclaims softly as I shed her tears. “It felt like... the first time I danced along.”
          <br><br>
          “With the previous one?” I ask. She nods immediately.
          <br><br>
          Ah, she can still vividly remember telling me about it months ago. Together with the ship and everything.
          <br><br>
          As we continue to dance under the moonlight, I slightly glance to see Tsukushi a bit flushed. What’s weird though is that she
          looks at me in a rather embarrassed look. As I glance back to Fiona, I can feel my cheeks getting a bit red.
          <br><br>
          She just gazes through me, her face a happy smile. “I know what’s gonna happen later after this dance. Just tell me.”
          <br><br>
          “Ah,” I shake my head. “It’s nothing... unless you’re thinking of Tsukushi.”
          <br><br>
          “I see,” Fiona nods her head, spinning her body around for a bit as the music continues to play.
          <br><br>
          At the distance, Tsukushi can be seen fidgeting with her fingers as she dances along to the music, not knowing that Fiona and I
          stop our dance to see her. From there, she would appear to be enjoying herself from her seat.
          <br><br>
          As soon as she realizes that we stopped dancing, she shrieks immediately. “Ack!”
          <br><br>
          Fiona chuckles softly, stretching her right arm. “May you join us in this dance?”
          <br><br>
          “Eeh?” Tsukushi shrieks. “A- are you serious?”
          <br><br>
          “It wouldn’t hurt if you try,” I said, looking at the others who appear to be locked on her for an odd reason. “We should see
          you dance, somehow.”
          <br><br>
          “I, uh... you...” She sighs heavily, looking at my composure.
          <br><br>
          Giving in, she slowly gets into the centerstage where I let her and Fiona dance as I tend to the empty plates for a while.
          Nagisa softly holds my hand and whispers into my ear: “I heard Tsukushi has been acting strange lately... she’s not in her usual
          self.”
          <br><br>
          “Oh?”
          <br><br>
          “There was an unconfirmed rumor that she likes to tend strangely to photos of hot guys and gals, although unsure why she has
          that behavior. Some say she’s been prone to lack of self-esteem that may contribute to that as well. Others say she just wants
          to see them and be enticed in their looks. When she got to Fukushima for a tourist visit, she even spoke to the psychologist at
          a clinic where I was working part-time. I don’t know the exact details of what the psychologist said, but what I can vaguely
          remember is that Tsukushi could have been lacking self-care and self-appreciation due to peer pressure.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s a lot to dig in.”
          <br><br>
          “I could’ve been wrong... but either way, I think it’s best if you both should talk about it as early as tonight. Maybe you can
          even get to help her if fate permits.”
          <br><br>
          I nod. “Yeah, I should do that.”
          <br><br>
          Putting the plates down on the kitchen sink, Nagisa slowly leans her head around my shoulder. “I couldn’t imagine what she had
          to go through in order to get here. Times have been rough for her to handle.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, let’s head back there while we can,” I said, cleansing my hands with tap water as we had back outside. Not only Tsukushi
          and Fiona get to enjoy the rest of the dance, so are the other girls who, for some odd reason, glanced at our arrival.
          <br><br>
          “We’ve been expecting you,” Misaki approaches, handing me a note. It reads as follows:
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> I just want to write this to let you know that Tsukushi isn’t getting any
            better, no matter how hard we try. We might need your help this time as her emotions seem to deteriorate.
            <br><br>
            It’s been years since she knew about the previous Owner’s disappearance. We haven’t heard from her since. She appears to have
            disappeared or escaped from the island without us knowing, too. Hopefully we can get to find her starting next week upon release
            of this notice.
          </div>
          <br>
          “Who... wrote this?” I ask Misaki.
          <br><br>
          Silence soon ensued as the music came to a halt. Tsukushi and Fiona stopped dancing and glanced around. Slowly, Lobelia approaches
          from my left, raising her hand. “It’s me.”
          <br><br>
          “Lobee,” I sigh.
          <br><br>
          “I know what you’re thinking. That note is really old,” she points to the note I held in my hand. “But the important part is on the
          first line: Tsukushi isn’t getting any better whatsoever.”
          <br><br>
          “She appears fine, I guess.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s not the point. You see, back when she heard about the disappearance, she did nothing but just cry in her room. She refused
          to participate in Festivals, and oftentimes during special occasions, too. I think she also lost control of movement in her body
          for some reason?”
          <br><br>
          I sigh deeply, hearing those words. “That’s really bad.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah... I couldn’t help but wonder if we still have some other options besides being at her side at all times.”
          <br><br>
          “Hm.”
          <br><br>
          Upon hearing the discussion, Tsukushi slowly broke down to the ground, her eyes gazing at the sand below her knees as she started
          crying, Fiona slowly trying to calm her down. Nyotengu and Helena follow suit, and the others back to their seats.
          <br><br>
          “I’ll talk to her about this, and maybe we might shed some light on her emotional trauma.”
          <br><br>
          “I agree with you,” Elise approaches the pact, her gaze at mine. “The truth is, we’re just unable to find out about her emotional
          complications and that it got worse. Maybe there’s a way to minimize those effects.”
          <br><br>
          I somehow can hear Tsuuku’s soft cries as she musters the words: “I knew it, no one loves me...”
          <br><br>
          Sighing, I immediately set off to Fiona. “Please take her to the Suite. I’ll talk to her after this one.”
          <br><br>
          She nods, carrying Tsukushi by the shoulders as they head inside the mansion. I cleared my throat, and spoke the following words:
          “Alright girls, that wraps up the party for the night. I know things have been pretty hard; but as long as I’m here, I’ll make sure
          everyone is happy by the end of the day. I’ll see you tomorrow morning.”
          <br><br>
          As the girls head inside with their belongings, Elise holds my right hand. “This week has been very tough,” she said.
          <br><br>
          “Yeah.” I nod. “I just can’t help but try to help her the best I can, though I’m not sure how that would turn out...”
          <br><br>
          “You can do it. I believe in you,” Elise smiled, kissing my cheek. “If you can help me with my downward thoughts, I’m sure you can
          help her too.”
          <br><br>
          “Thanks for the kind words, Elise. I’ll keep them in mind,” I said, letting go of her hand as I head to the Suite. Inside, Fiona
          and Misaki are busy trying to calm her down, but to no avail. Elise follows suit as I head in, trying to see what on earth is going
          on.
          <br><br>
          “She’s still sobbing,” Fiona tries patting Tsukushi’s back. The cries can be heard by everyone heading to their rooms as the door
          was left open.
          <br><br>
          I sigh, trying to pat her head. She calms down for a bit, gazing at my face. “Um... ?”
          <br><br>
          “You’ll be okay... unless you tell me you aren’t.”
          <br><br>
          Tsukushi immediately shakes her head a no. “I’m always like this... it can’t be helped.”
          <br><br>
          I sigh deeply, trying to sit beside her. “Girls, I’ll take it from here. Hopefully I got this sorted out by tomorrow.”
          <br><br>
          “Will do,” Fiona nods, instructing Misaki and Elise to go back to their rooms.
          <br><br>
          As soon as they close the door, we’re left with a sheer silence as Tsukushi firmly clings on my right arm. Sniffing in defeat, she
          tries to speak her own words, but fails.
          <br><br>
          “I know,” I softly pat her head. “Just tell me what’s wrong.”
          <br><br>
          “You see, it’s just a complicated mess that I have to go through. Probably something you aren’t even interested in looking into.”
          <br><br>
          “Just... tell me.”
          <br><br>
          Tsukushi sighs, still clinging onto my arm. “Alright... here goes. What Nagisa told you about what happened was true. I have an emotional
          problem which contributed to my lack of self-esteem. I act strange around people, I will admit. It almost feels like I’m helpless and
          hopeless, that whenever I take my chances to speak to guys I always feel weird.”
          <br><br>
          I sigh. “That’s... that’s a lot.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s not even the worst part. I got into a relationship months before I came here for the first time, but he broke up with me because
          he found out about my weakness and left me for a better girl. Who wants a girl like me, anyway?”
          <br><br>
          “That’s horrible! No one should do that to you...” I shriek, holding her close.
          <br><br>
          She tried to continue her words, but her emotions turned to a sob. She can’t help but let her tears out on my clothes. “W- why should I
          b- be here, anyway?”
          <br><br>
          “Please don’t say that,” I tried to calm her down. “There’s always a way for everything.”
          <br><br>
          She sniffs in a sorry state. “You could say that, but how? I’m always like this.”
          <br><br>
          I try to soothe her down by humming to a song that I think she might like. “You know, I always wonder what would be the next step. I
          mean, I almost went the same route as you do. Oftentimes, people would reach out to me about their problems and how I could help them.”
          <br><br>
          Upon knowing one of my expertise, her eyes lit up. “Do you think you can help me? I mean... it’s okay if you don’t.”
          <br><br>
          “Don’t worry about it,” I patted her head. “If I could help Nagisa and Elise, then I can help you too.”
          <br><br>
          Her gaze locked upon me as she realized something. The more she can rant out about her problems, the more I can help her on how to
          alleviate such.
          <br><br>
          <i>The next morning...</i>
          <br><br>
          The morning sun awaits our presence as I head out of bed. It’s already 7-o’clock in the morning, which is my usual time to get up.
          Tending to Tsukushi before I left the Suite, Helena was already waiting for me downstairs in the kitchen. She only wears an apron--nothing
          else, which makes me feel nervous for some reason.
          <br><br>
          “How’s your sleep, sweetie?” Helena asks. I forgot to tell you that she calls me sweetie now. <b>Details about that will be revealed in the
          Epilogue of the Main Story.</b>
          <br><br>
          “I’m good; how about yours?”
          <br><br>
          “Somehow... I don’t know what to cook for Mama Nyo now that we’re nearing her special week.”
          <br><br>
          It’s already Saturday, 16 November. Tomorrow will be her special week, with Tuesday being her birthday, at the 19th. “She must be excited
          about that, I guess.”
          <br><br>
          She shrugs, proceeding to her cooking routines. I could only look at her naked back because I still have some things to do.
          <br><br>
          “Oh! You’re finally awake, Ona-dono,” Nyotengu immediately greets me on my way out. “What’s Helen doing?”
          <br><br>
          “Cooking for something, I guess.”
          <br><br>
          “She mustn’t forget the Japanese Manjū I told her about!” She smiles gracefully, her wings still of the same tenderness like the last time.
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, I might try doing that when I have time,” I said, heading to the café where Misaki and Fiona are waiting with their coffee in hand. I
          also noticed that Helen’s Violet Fizz was just left there.
          <br><br>
          “Helen’s been doing that since both of you got together, at least.” Fiona hands me a mug of coffee.
          <br><br>
          “Seriously?” I take my sip.
          <br><br>
          “Yeah... I don’t know why,” Misaki responds, feeling doubtful about her actions. “I haven’t seen her naked in public before... at least within
          this island, of course.”
          <br><br>
          “She’s wearing an apron, though.”
          <br><br>
          “Go figure. Anyways, how’s Tsukushi? Is she alright?”
          <br><br>
          I nod, taking a seat. “Uh-huh. She’s feeling better now, I guess.”
          <br><br>
          They both nod, sipping in their coffee as well.
          <br><br>
          <i>A few minutes later...</i>
          <br><br>
          Helena came back from the kitchen, bringing in a special cuisine to the table: Vegetable salad with a mix of broccoli and celery. She also
          made a special Japanese Manjū that Nyotengu wanted her to make.
          <br><br>
          “Uh... can I ask for your verdict on this?” Helena asks, handing me the Manjū. “It’s my first time making some, I guess.”
          <br><br>
          “Oh sure,” I take the bread from her, slowly chewing it in my mouth. It’s not really that bite-sized, but as long as it’s good, any size is
          fine.
          <br><br>
          I kept chewing for a few minutes when Tsukushi came to join us, sitting beside Misaki. She wore a brown bathrobe and had her messy hair like
          usual. It looks like she’s ready to take a shower or something.
          <br><br>
          “This looks pretty good!” I exclaim, finishing my verdict as I empty out the Manjū and sip on my coffee. Helena looks pleased.
          <br><br>
          “Thank you! I should be able to make more of these for the others to try,” she said, her hands on her cheeks.
          <br><br>
          “Anyways, why don’t you join us? I’ll prepare you some coffee if you’d like.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, about that...” she fiddles with her fingers. “I forgot to take my coffee before I started cooking.” Afterwards, she proceeds to sit
          beside me.
          <br><br>
          “Alright, it’ll be in a minute.” I said, standing up to proceed to the counter. Making a special blend of cinnamon and chocolate, I paired it
          with a few Blancmanges.
          <br><br>
          I return to the table, handing the plate to Helen as I continue sipping my coffee. She then proceeds to give us the Blancmanges, one for each.
          <br><br>
          “This tastes really good!” Misaki glances in awe. Tsukushi and Fiona exchange nods. I feel a little surprised, knowing it’s the same Blancmanges
          that I had eaten for the first time.
          <br><br>
          As soon as everyone was finished, I set off to the Suite, with Tsukushi clinging to my left arm. “So soft,” she mustered. I just chuckle as I
          softly pat her head.
          <br><br>
          <i>That sunset afternoon...</i>
          <br><br>
          I was almost done with writing the next journal entry when Tsukushi approached behind me with a frown on her face. “Is something the matter?” I
          ask.
          <br><br>
          “U- um... Can I a- ask you a little f- favor?” She slowly but firmly holds my hand as she stutters through words.
          <br><br>
          “Oh sure, what is it?” I respond with a smile on my face.
          <br><br>
          “Y- you see...” she pauses for a bit, then sighs deeply. “I adored you for so long because of what you did to me. Even though I acted like some
          weirdo, you tried your absolute best to take care of me, day and night.”
          <br><br>
          “Hey, as long as you’re fine, we’re good,” I chuckle, patting her head. Little did I know that she quickly grabbed my hand just to cup her cheeks.
          <br><br>
          “T- the truth is, I don’t know how I could repay you... I don’t know what else to do besides this.”
          <br><br>
          Slowly, she approaches forward, her hands slowly wrapping my waist. Just before I could react, she immediately pressed her lips against mine, her
          tears flowing down her cheeks as sends me a tender kiss in the sunset sky. The embrace became tighter and tighter that I almost left out of breath.
          Her eyeglasses almost broke, but her feelings refuse to react.
          <br><br>
          “I yearned to do this... for years,” Tsukushi softly whispers, her embrace as tight as ever. “But I don’t know if it’s worth it.”
          <br><br>
          “I know what you mean-”
          <br><br>
          “But please,” Tsukushi asserts. “Please let me do this for once. Please let me feel the love burning in my heart... for you...”
          <br><br>
          I just sigh as I don’t have the capacity to react at this time, considering her desire to yearn for love at the very beginning.
          <br><br>
          <i>Approximately three years before the Epilogue...</i>
          <br><br>
          As I went into the rooms, I just found a strange note from the bed. I’m currently at Tsukushi’s room as I try to clean the mess. Upon opening the
          note, it reveals a message:
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> I don’t feel loved by my family nor my neighbors in my hometown, that’s why I came here as a
            tourist. I didn’t know that they wanted me to stay here in exchange for improving my emotions. I just feel it’s pointless to even think about
            trying to feel love when there’s nothing left in me... or so I thought. Misaki does a good job in staying beside me at most times, and Ayane agreed
            to bond with me every weekend, but... I still can’t fathom how I still am not able to feel anything. I might ask Ona-san about this or something.
          </div>
          <br>
          “That’s a pain in the gut,” I thought to myself, reading the note. Remembering that the girls are busy setting up the decorations for Nagisa’s
          birthday, I quickly take the note and continue with my duties.
          <br><br>
          <i>That evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          I quickly begin to examine the note and try to understand the words. “It looks like she’d been through a lot before she came here.”
          <br><br>
          Suddenly, Elise arrived with a frown on her face. Helena and Nyotengu follow suit, with the Kunoichi Sisters (Kasumi and Ayane) behind them.
          “Ona-san?” Elise asked, prompting me to turn my back.
          <br><br>
          “Yeah?”
          <br><br>
          “Tsukushi is nowhere to be seen,” Helena broke the suspense.
          <br><br>
          “Yeah... we tried looking for her everywhere but to no avail. We ordered the girls to aid us in our search, but they found nothing,” Nyotengu added.
          <br><br>
          “I’m...” I’m in shock about that. “This is bad.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah,” Kasumi approaches, Ayane following suit as they sit on the floor. “Maybe you can help us find her.”
          <br><br>
          “Sure, I can do that,” I said, turning to pick the note. As soon as I do, their heads appear curious.
          <br><br>
          “What’s that?” Ayane asked.
          <br><br>
          “Oh... It seems Tsukushi left a note in her bedroom,” I responded, handing the note to the girls. As soon as they read it, they soon realize.
          <br><br>
          Elise looks at me with a slightly sadder look. “Yeah... she’d gone through a lot. I just can’t imagine how many emotional breakdowns she had to go
          through in order to regain her composure and essentially come here.”
          <br><br>
          I nod. “Agreed.”
          <br><br>
          “What should we do?” Nyotengu asks.
          <br><br>
          Recollecting my thoughts, I immediately stand up. “Alright, please return the note to her room... I’ll take it from here. I’ll search for her.”
          <br><br>
          “Would that be alright? Do you need some help or something?” Kasumi asked.
          <br><br>
          I shake my head. “I appreciate it, but I need to do this alone for the meantime. If I do need some assistance, then be ready for it. For now, you
          should head to bed as it’s already late in the evening.”
          <br><br>
          “Alright, you got it.” Elise smiles.
          <br><br>
          <i>The next few minutes...</i>
          <br><br>
          I begin searching for Tsukushi outside the mansion, starting from the café. Although she’s nowhere to be seen, she appears to leave a note on the
          table. It reads:
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> I don’t seem to write notes often to show how I feel, but I know that you’re going to know
            about my true emotions soon.
            <br><br>
            Ona-san, I’m in the bushes across the jungle, crying myself to sleep.
          </div>
          <br>
          “How in the... ?” I stood in shock. How did she even know that I’ll find her tonight?
          <br><br>
          But alas, no time to waste. I set off to locate her in the jungle. From there, I can hear her soft crying noises as I approach closer. She lays
          down on the leaves, her face full of tears, her clothes badly torn to pieces, revealing her naked figure.
          <br><br>
          I slowly caress her hair, only for her to immediately get up and pull me into an embrace. “Ona... san... what did I do wrong?”
          <br><br>
          “I know,” I slowly tend to her sorrows, softly patting her back.
          <br><br>
          “I...”
          <br><br>
          She remained speechless for the next few minutes, the sorrows not letting her say a single word. I could only listen to her cries as she tried
          to calm herself down. I could only hum in hopes that she does.
          <br><br>
          <i>Two days later...</i>
          <br><br>
          “She’s sick,” Marie Rose said. “I don’t know why that happened.”
          <br><br>
          “I see,” I said, standing up from my seat. It’s been a few days since I found her crying in the bushes in the jungle, and for some reason she
          didn’t feel well. In a nutshell, the issue regarding her non-participation still remains in place.
          <br><br>
          Immediately, we set off to the clinic to find Sayuri tending to Tsukushi’s sickness. I carefully place my hand over her neck, examining carefully.
          “She feels hot; what’s her temperature?”
          <br><br>
          “42°C. Very unusual for a Venus to have this kind of temperature,” Sayuri revealed the results. “Could her emotional incapacity be the reason?”
          <br><br>
          “I don’t think so... we’ll investigate further.”
          <br><br>
          Tsukushi is still on the medical bed when she attempts to open her eyes. Slowly, she tries to speak: “Ona... saaaaan...”
          <br><br>
          Upon hearing her calling my name, I immediately approached to check up on her. “Yes?”
          <br><br>
          From there, she could just smile at me. “I might be unable to participate for a full month or two. Please try your best to take care of me if you
          can.”
          <br><br>
          I slowly nod, smiling as I caress  her hair. “Don’t worry, I will.”
          <br><br>
          As Sayuri and I had an agreement to transfer her to the Suite, I immediately began moving her things over there just so that I can just grab one
          if she wants to. Guess I’ll be on caretaker duty.
          <br><br>
          Tending to her temperature changes now and then, I begin to feel something odd. As she sleeps, she keeps the buttons open, revealing a part of her
          naked torso. I’m not completely sure if that’s just a part of her evening routine, or...
          <br><br>
          Nevertheless, upon placing the cold compress on her forehead, I softly held her hand, then proceeded to sort her things out. I left most of her
          stuff untouched as she just needs the essential ones for this occasion.
          <br><br>
          As soon as I finished sorting the clothes in the wardrobe, I just noticed her sketch pad laying about in the briefcase. No, there are three sketch
          pads and a case containing a bunch of pencils and erasers of various sizes.
          <br><br>
          Emptying the last briefcase, I put them on the table to inspect. From the biography book I read about, it explicitly mentioned that she aspires
          to be a manga creator someday, and that the previous Owner gave her some interesting remarks. But despite that, her effort appears to be barren.
          <br><br>
          Looking through the pages of the respective sketch pads, they reveal the initial sketches of the girls as they interact with each other, and her
          character trying to make the cut. “Hm,” I thought. “How can I remedy this?”
          <br><br>
          <i>The following evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          As I tend to Tsukushi’s sickness every thirty minutes, I begin drafting my own take on the manga based on her sketches and rejected proposals.
          Carefully, I examine her workflow of the story to make my own.
          <br><br>
          Not realizing that she opens her eyes, she begins to tell me a lot about her hobby. “You know, I used to make my own when I had that much
          inspiration... but my constant pressure caused me to have a lot of bad things on my hands, even up to this day. My proposals were rejected, peer
          pressure causing a series of mood swings, and my emotional incapacity. Sometimes, I always thought of giving up that hobby. It just doesn’t
          feel... right.”
          <br><br>
          Pausing on my work to check up on her, I respond with a smile on my face: “All of us are thinking of the same thing as you do, in different
          aspects. What’s important is that if we continue to pursue our desire to do something great, those thoughts will essentially disappear in the
          wind and will never be in our way.”
          <br><br>
          “I suppose you can say that,” she chuckles. “What urged you to be the new Owner of this precious island? I’m curious about your thoughts.”
          <br><br>
          I sigh softly, looking at her with a kiss on her forehead. “You see, I wasn’t really in the mood for something until I came across an agent who
          claims to be working with the girls here, holding pamphlets for a supposed recruitment. Not knowing what it was, I left the offer on queue for
          the meantime. But that doesn’t mean I don’t get to help them or anything, so I decided to do some shopping and give some financial assistance in
          exchange. Then I asked her to go back to this island so that the others can enjoy the gift.”
          <br><br>
          “I’m not sure if you’re aware of it, but... it was me all along. I was the agent you’re talking about.” Tsukushi covers her mouth with her hands.
          <br><br>
          “Wha-” I could just stare at her in shock.
          <br><br>
          She smiles at me, holding my hand. “You see, when I told them about the packages you sent, they were completely in shock as they haven’t seen
          those before. A bunch of essential goods since we’re running low on ingredients at that time.”
          <br><br>
          “Ah,” I nod.
          <br><br>
          “I can’t believe that it will be you who will guide us through this... you’ve earned a lot of respect from us girls and we’re grateful to have
          you around here. I’ll always remember the first time we met.”
          <br><br>
          The following evenings were me trying to draft for my own manga. As her condition continues to improve, she helped me in my quest to complete
          my first-ever romantic manga (I don’t know why that happened, but there it is anyway). Months later, we took a break for three months to focus
          on story writing and graphics with the girls: Nyotengu and Helena being the lead writers, Tsukushi and I being the lead design, and Nagisa being
          the associate designer. We continue to work day and night, as we bond together for the rest of our lives.
          <br><br>
          <i>Three days after the Epilogue...</i>
          <br><br>
          I finally woke up the following morning to find myself inside Tsukushi’s room, already renovated together with the rest of the rooms. The mansion
          (and the rest of the island) got a bit of a big overhaul after what happened with the Omega. <b><i>As those were spoilers I won’t be sharing them
            for now. Stay tuned on how it unfolds in the Main Story.</i></b> Remembering the promise that Tsukushi and I kept throughout my time here, I
            immediately got out of bed to look for the crate.
          <br><br>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <b>When I come back to our precious island, we’ll complete the manga in time for the big event. I’m sure we’ll be a wonder to watch out for.</b>
          </div>
          <br>
          Helena immediately enters the room, looking for me. “Sweetie?”
          <br><br>
          “Uh- yeah?”
          <br><br>
          “Tsukushi is expecting you outside. Maybe she found what you’re looking for.”
          <br><br>
          “The crate!” I exclaim, quickly heading outside to find the girls waiting for me with the crate in front of them. Tsukushi and Fiona approach
          forward, greeting in simultaneous, “Welcome home, Ona-sama.”
          <br><br>
          I could only glance in awe as the girls approached together to give me their sweetest group embrace. When everyone is done, Tsukushi holds my
          hand as firmly as she could. “Let’s go.”
          <br><br>
          Approaching the crate, on the count of three, we give it a strong lift. Inside are a bunch of art materials, A4 papers and sketch pads presumed
          to be salvaged from the chaos. “Luckily, we managed to salvage all of them thanks to you,” she beams at me.
          <br><br>
          I sigh in relief, smiling as I take the first sketch pad out of the crate. Flipping to the most recent page, I just discovered that she’s halfway
          done with the last episode of the manga.
          <br><br>
          <i>Present day...</i>
          <br><br>
          As we are still holding close in a tight embrace, my gaze turns to the table. Alongside the journal notebook is the last A4 paper for the last
          panels of the manga. We’re almost three quarters done, all we need are three panels to finish the whole series.
          <br><br>
          “Tsukushi...” I whisper in her ear.
          <br><br>
          “... yes?” She slowly looks at me with a rather sweetheart look.
          <br><br>
          “Do you want to finish the series together?” I ask in a straightforward manner. It’s been weeks since we last worked on the final episode, we’re
          not entirely sure on how to end it in a way that will forever live in the hearts of the readers.
          <br><br>
          “Let’s do it.”
          <br><br>
          And so we begin completing the final three panels. We became teary-eyed as we completed the two.
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> 
            <div style="text-align: center;">
              I’m finally grateful that I’ve already reached the finish line of my journey to a new beginning. It was quite a sacrifice to begin with, and I
              managed to get through them with grace and love between my shoes. It’s quite a feast to begin with.
              <br><br>
              As I end my long journey, I just want to take this opportunity to say that I’ve finally found someone who’ll be with me for the rest of my life.
              A few months left and we’ll finally get married! Can you believe it?
              <br><br>
              I’m not sure if I should continue any further, but all I can say is that I want you to keep going through your life; and that despite everything,
              you still have a shoulder to carry on. I’m happy to be a part of your journey as you’re on your end of reading this series. And I’m grateful that
              we’ve talked about a lot.
              <br><br>
              I guess I’ll see you in the not-too-distant future. Carry on, my precious butterflies. With regards, Yuka Nagano-Ocampo.
              <br><br>
              THE END
            </div>
          </div>
          <br>
          The final panel shows a couple kissing under the sunset as the main character, Yuka, expresses her final thoughts. This is what Tsukushi and I just
          did after we finalized the panel with the words “THE END” at the bottom, complete with our signatures.
