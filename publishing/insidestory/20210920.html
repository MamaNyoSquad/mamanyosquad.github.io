        <h1>Admirant of the Past</h1>
        <h3>Fiona’s Inside Story</h3>
        <em>Published 20 September 2021</em>
        <p>
          Browsing through the biography book were some of her interesting experiences at the island, including her deep affection,
          revealing her nature of being an admirer. Admitting that it was the previous Owner whom she admired, how could she handle
          the stresses of being with him back to her faraway home?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <i>
            This part of the Inside Story takes place months before the previous Owner’s disappearance, the Prologue of Venus
            Island Diaries - Main Story.
          </i>
          <br><br>
          <b>POV: Fiona</b>
          <br><br>
          It’s already past 3-o’clock in the afternoon.
          <br><br>
          As I look inside the wardrobe which contains a collection of outfits that I took before my arrival on this island, I
          notice a light-purple gown which I used to wear to take photos of myself back at the palace. It looks different from the
          outfit I wore when I stepped in to meet him in person, in terms of the design.
          <br><br>
          It has a Tanzanite on both sides, sprinkled with a bit of Aquamarine and Lavender Quartz, and a translucent veil helming the
          skirt. Attached to it is a picture of my family--The King and Queen.
          <br><br>
          As soon as I was about to pull the gown out, I heard a knock on the door. “Please come in.”
          <br><br>
          A tall, tender, pink-haired girl approaches behind me. It was Elise, a good friend of mine for a good few months following
          her arrival to this island. “That sure looks fantastic,” she said, admiring the gown I just pulled out of.
          <br><br>
          “Thanks,” I compliment, smiling as I turn to face her beauty. “To be honest, I don’t know which one to wear for tonight.”
          <br><br>
          “You can actually wear what you think suits you, but I gotta be honest here: That one looks pretty good,” she said, trying to
          take a closer look at the outfit I have in my hand. “When did you have it, by any chance?”
          <br><br>
          “A long time ago, I’m afraid.”
          <br><br>
          She glisters in awe as I say that sentence. “Please tell me more about it,” she begs.
          <br><br>
          “Alright... I mainly used this one for photoshoots back home at a faraway place,” I said, tending to the gown. “That was before
          I got the news about Ona-sama a few days later. The next thing I knew, I had already sent him a bunch of pictures because I
          wanted him to like it.”
          <br><br>
          “Wow... I didn’t expect you to be his admirer after all.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s why I came here in the first place... I want to make a good impression to sway him and make him feel that I love him very
          much... and be his perfect bride,” I smile.
          <br><br>
          “That’s pretty romantic, if I should say so myself,” Elise responds, a little moved by my responses.
          <br><br>
          “To be honest, I haven’t worn this for him just yet. I probably might, because I got some visitors coming.”
          <br><br>
          “Really? Who were they?”
          <br><br>
          I wink sweetfully. “You’ll see what I mean tonight. Now please excuse me for a bit as I try to wear this one.”
          <br><br>
          <i>That evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          “Ona-sama!!!” I called up to him who was looking at the ocean. I approach slowly, in the gown I haven’t shown to him yet. You
          know, the light-purple one. “How do I look?”
          <br><br>
          “You’re... beautiful,” he expresses his awe, holding my hands. Elise approaches us in her casual outfit. He’s also wearing his
          casual one.
          <br><br>
          “She wanted to show you her gown for a long time. I’m not sure if you haven’t heard of it,” she spills the beans, making me
          slightly upset.
          <br><br>
          “Elise!!!”
          <br><br>
          He chuckles, a smile on his face. “It’s alright. I actually didn’t see that coming, to be honest.”
          <br><br>
          “Really?”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah,” he releases my hands, looking at my pristine figure.
          <br><br>
          “Oh right, we got some visitors from home. They’ll be right here in a few minutes,” I informed immediately, catching Elise’s
          attention.
          <br><br>
          “You got it,” Elise said, then left the area to prepare the clipboard.
          <br><br>
          “I guess she’s mentally prepared for this thing.”
          <br><br>
          “Of course,” I chuckle. “She’s been into training since she arrived. Call her a tour guide or a waitress, everything goes.”
          <br><br>
          “Wow.”
          <br><br>
          She immediately comes back, a few things in her hand. On her left is a clipboard and a pen, while on her right is a bunch of
          greeting cards. Oh wait, when was the last time we had an arts and crafts project of that equivalent?
          <br><br>
          He takes the greeting cards, pulling his own pen out of his pocket. Looking at me, he said in a lighter tone: “Let’s get to
          work. It should buy us time before they arrive on time.”
          <br><br>
          “Wait, what should we do with the greeting cards?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          “Let’s put the names of your family on each of these,” he suggests. “I’m sure they’ll like these as much as you do.”
          <br><br>
          I nod immediately, tending to some of the cards while Elise is waiting for the ship to arrive. That begs a question: Did they
          bring my pet dog with them?
          <br><br>
          <i>Minutes later...</i>
          <br><br>
          We’re almost done with the enumeration when we heard the ship’s siren. It’s one of the ships that’s named after me: The S.S.
          Royal Fiona III. Elise instructed the ship to direct to the pier, where we’ll be waiting for it to arrive.
          <br><br>
          At the pier, Misaki was waiting patiently for the visitors, flower necklaces in her hand. “I can’t believe the Royals will be
          here for the Princess,” she thought, immediately pausing to see us coming towards her direction. “Wait, Fiona’s the Princess?!”
          <br><br>
          “Misaki-sama,” I approached her gracefully, revealing the gown. “How do I look?”
          <br><br>
          “That’s pretty good,” she exclaims, turning to the left to see the ship about to dock. The girls begin to appear from all
          directions just to see the ship as it opens the entryway door.
          <br><br>
          The first to come out is my pet dog, John. As soon as he jumps to reach for my arms, other personalities start to get out of the
          ship, with Misaki greeting them one by one and Ona-sama giving them each a greeting card.
          <br><br>
          The butler is the next one to come out, approaching my direction to take a look at my gown. “You’ve done pretty well. This gown
          really suits you better.”
          <br><br>
          “Thank you,” I compliment with a smile on my face.
          <br><br>
          Just in time for the King and Queen to come out, in their most regal outfits possible. As Misaki tends to their flower necklaces,
          they turn their attention to Ona-sama who’s about to give them greeting cards. “So you’re the one our daughter was talking about,”
          he said, beginning the conversation.
          <br><br>
          “Yep,” Ona-sama replies, giving the last greeting card to the Queen.
          <br><br>
          “I can’t imagine how you would handle her briefly during her stay here. She must be very grateful to have you on her side,” the
          Queen said, patting his right shoulder as she turned to face me.
          <br><br>
          “Let’s get inside, then. The food is waiting to be served to our dear guests,” Misaki reprimands, leading the way inside the
          mansion. Ona-sama and I follow, holding hands as the butler tends to my dog. The others follow suit. Luckily, the girls were in
          their own Champs Elysees before they greeted the visitors. I’m not quite sure why.
          <br><br>
          Inside, various veggies and meat buffets are ready for everyone to enjoy dinner. Nagisa prepares the last of the dishes, seeing
          Ona-sama with a rather comfortable look. She’s actually our cook for this week, so that’s why she had a lot of dinner ideas.
          <br><br>
          One of them is the world-famous pork adobo. Believe it or not, we have prepared a Filipino cuisine for the first time in our
          lives. How quaint.
          <br><br>
          As everyone sits down except me, Ona-sama, the King and Queen, and Nagisa; I formally begin the dinner with a prayer. The King
          follows suit with a formal introduction, with the Queen telling how much excitement they had in visiting this island for the
          first time. Now it’s my turn to speak for the guests, not as a resident of the island... but as Ona-sama’s fiancé.
          <br><br>
          You heard it right. I stayed here just so that I can participate in festivals and train to be his perfect bride.
          <br><br>
          As words came out of my mouth, everyone clapped gracefully as they began to notice their new King in line. My father just told
          everyone that when I became the new Queen, I’ll be married to my future King, hence, he pointed to my relationship with Ona-sama.
          I turned back to see Nagisa in shock.
          <br><br>
          And then I remember something that she promised a few weeks ago, that she needs to stay close to him for the whole month.
          <br><br>
          I whisper in his ear, “Hey, about Nagisa...”
          <br><br>
          He nods, hopefully that he knows what to do. As soon as he instructs everyone to enjoy dinner, he then asks Nagisa and I to head
          outside to talk about things.
          <br><br>
          Nagisa immediately hugs him after we head to the café. “Please don’t leave me,” she begs.
          <br><br>
          I slowly lean forward and pat her head. He tries to calm her down, holding her hands as firmly as he can.
          <br><br>
          “I know it’s hard for me to admit what I feel, but...”
          <br><br>
          “I know,” Nagisa interrupts my statement. “But what about me? I liked him too.”
          <br><br>
          Gently caressing her back, Ona-sama responds, “I know...”
          <br><br>
          With no words left to mutter in each of us three, all we can do is just hug it out until she has been calmed down for the rest of
          the night.
          <br><br>
          <i>The next morning...</i>
          <br><br>
          I finally wake up to find myself in the Suite together with Ona-sama and Nagisa at the same time. She appears happy at this point,
          although I’m not sure how long that’ll last.
          <br><br>
          Nevertheless, I’m the first to get up, making Ona-sama his own coffee and Nagisa her own Strawberry Shake. Returning to the Suite
          to give them the delicacies, they’re already up, looking for me.
          <br><br>
          “Good morning,” I immediately said to them upon entering.
          <br><br>
          “Good morning to you, too,” Ona-sama and Nagisa both said back, with a smile on their faces.
          <br><br>
          “How about you? You don’t want breakfast?” He asks me, realizing that I haven’t made my own yet. Oops.
          <br><br>
          Placing the tray on the table, I hurriedly rush back to the kitchen to make myself some Herbal Tea. Luckily, I made it back to the
          Suite in time just to see them about to drink their blends. “Sorry about that...”
          <br><br>
          “No problem,” Nagisa smiles, patting on the cushion. “Now come join in.”
          <br><br>
        As I sit with my tea in hand, Ona-sama asks me directly, “How’s the family? Have they been doing well?”
          <br><br>
          I nod. “Yeah... It’s their first time being here, so I guess they’ll be alright.”
          <br><br>
          “I can see that,” Nagisa sips her shake. “But, what do you think they’ll be doing next?”
          <br><br>
          “I don’t know,” I sip. I didn’t even realize that they are still sleeping in the guest room, that I don’t know what to do next.
          <br><br>
          As he sips in his coffee, he pulls out a clipboard which lists what might be doing next. “Let’s see...”
          <br><br>
          <i>The next hour...</i>
          <br><br>
          I’m in my Sweet Chocolatier as I walk around the bay, wondering what they were doing as of late. I saw the Queen by the pier,
          looking at the ocean.
          <br><br>
          As I approach her by the right, she turns to smile at me. “So, has everything been good?”
          <br><br>
          “Yes, your Majesty.”
          <br><br>
          “I see,” the Queen turns back to gazing at the ocean. “I can remember one moment when my husband treated me to somewhere like this.
          It just feels mesmerizing for some reason.”
          <br><br>
          I stood over by her side, also watching the ocean as they went. “Can you please tell me about it?”
          <br><br>
          She nods, holding my hand. “You see, it was my first time when he took me out to a private island full of tranquility and memories.
          We had a lot of fun and quality time together, and that became a perfect spot for our dates, to be precise about it. We carried over
          the memories of staying there back at the palace.”
          <br><br>
          “At least you don’t get bored while doing so.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s right. Hopefully that happened to you during your stay here.”
          <br><br>
          “It was, and I’m grateful to be here. Not just because I enjoyed the amenities and everything this island has to offer, I feel more
          grateful that I met him... the one whom I chose to be with for the rest of my life... my precious Ona-sama.”
          <br><br>
          “I can see that,” she smiles at me.
          <br><br>
          From afar, I can see Ona-sama tending to some of the girls, while Nagisa is still clinging onto his arm. “I guess the others feel the
          same way I do,” I said.
          <br><br>
          It didn’t take quite long for the butler to approach us two, together with my pet dog John. “How is he doing?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          “Oh, he’s doing just fine,” he said, tending to the dog. “He’s having his time here without causing much trouble.”
          <br><br>
          “Pretty good,” the Queen smiles in delight. “Now, what should we do next?”
          <br><br>
          “I don’t know,” I said, looking back at the activities by the bay, just in time for Ona-sama to approach in my direction with a box
          in his hands.
          <br><br>
          As he hands the box to the Queen, I let out a curious look. What could be in that box?
          <br><br>
          “Should we open it around the block?” I ask, asking to carry the box.
          <br><br>
          “Sure,” the Queen nods. “It’s for us anyway.”
          <br><br>
          As we head over to the café, I immediately open the box to find a couple of things: A photobook, a bunch of letters, two rings, and
          a regal outfit?
          <br><br>
          Immediately pulling the outfit from the box, I showed it to him with a confused look on my face. “What’s this?”
          <br><br>
          “I, uh... I actually wanted to sew something like this for a long time. I hope you like it,” he looks away, a little flushed.
          <br><br>
          “Really?”
          <br><br>
          He nods slowly.
          <br><br>
          I glance in awe. “I can’t wait to wear this!”
          <br><br>
          The Queen glances at me as I run to the mansion to try the outfit. “She surely is excited to put it on,” she told Ona-sama.
          <br><br>
          “I guess, yeah,” he answers, a little relieved for a bit.
          <br><br>
          <i>A few minutes trying to put on the outfit later...</i>
          <br><br>
          I came back to see the Queen and Ona-sama chatting about what’s in the photobook. “Your Majesty? Ona-sama? How do I look?” I said,
          approaching their direction.
          <br><br>
          “You’re very splendid,” the Queen gives her remarks with a smile on her face. She looks at Ona-sama, asking about him.
          <br><br>
          “Oh, magnificent. You’re actually fitting for a literal Princess, as far as I’m concerned,” he said, tending to the outfit.
          <br><br>
          By appearance, it’s a light-purple dress adorned with white truffles. Attached to the waistline are a bunch of flower petals which
          appear to be in a solution that will not make them wilt no matter what. (It’s strange, I know.) At the bottom of the skirt, sprinkles
          of pristine crystals--which they call V-Stones--can be seen. The veil on the back is well-made, adding a touch of translucent silk
          and purple threads on the sides. The same threads were used for the letter "F" which is at the bottom of the veil. I shrouded myself
          with a mixture of Jasmine and Aloe to make it fragrant, like the usual.
          <br><br>
          “You actually forgot something,” he said, picking up something from the box. “Now if you may close your eyes for a bit...”
          <br><br>
          I did what was told, as I felt something brushing through my hair. “Now you may open your eyes,” he said.
          <br><br>
          It was... a tiara?
          <br><br>
          “I actually want to do this ahead of time because you’ll be leaving tonight, I guess.”
          <br><br>
          “Wait, we’re leaving tonight?” I ask in surprise.
          <br><br>
          “You and your family,” he said, looking at the Queen. “I just told her that I don’t want to join you because of responsibilities that
          I must do here. I hope you can understand.”
          <br><br>
          As soon as she said that, tears began running down my face. “But... I can’t just leave you behind...”
          <br><br>
          Immediately tackling him into an embrace, I soon began to cry. “No... I can’t leave you! I don’t wanna leave!”
          <br><br>
          “B- but-”
          <br><br>
          “No!” I interrupt the Queen’s attempt to speak. “I’ll stay with him, whatever it takes. Even if it means I have to disobey the Crown.”
          <br><br>
          Slowly, he pats me on my back, telling me to calm down. “There, there. Look, I’ll promise to send you letters day and night during your
          stay there. I’ll even ask for the Queen’s blessing to install a telephone line at the palace so that I can call you every night.”
          <br><br>
          “T- telephone line?” The Queen asks in shock.
          <br><br>
          “Don’t worry. Fiona knows what to do,” he reassures, patting my head as I continue to let my tears out my eyes in dismay that I might
          not see him again as soon as I return to the island.
          <br><br>
          <i>That evening...</i>
          The ship sounds its siren, the whole family is inside. I’m about to board when Misaki runs into me for a final embrace... as mutual sisters.
          <br><br>
          “I know things will be very hard for you when I’m gone, but I’ll promise to come back here as soon as I’m able.”
          <br><br>
          “I know,” she cries. “But what about Ona?”
          <br><br>
          As soon as she said that, Ona-sama approached our direction, handing me an envelope. “Please read it before you go.”
          <br><br>
          I immediately pull from Misaki’s embrace, taking the envelope. Inside is a letter of appreciation which reads as follows:
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt="">
            Fiona,
            <br><br>
            I hope you’re safe upon returning to the palace. It’s been a ride ever since your first arrival here as a Venus, and you’re getting
            better as time goes by. You also helped me become the best I am, and others become what they are today.
            <br><br>
            I can’t help but feel appreciated because of your endless dedication to serve everyone better, and feel thankful for what you do to
            keep everyone happy.
            <br><br>
            I also want to say that I appreciate your commitment to make everyone worth your while, and confess your feelings as time goes by. I
            will always remember what you do to make us happy.
            <br><br>
            I just hope that you’ll return soon so that we can continue to connect our hearts for the better good. May I hope to be in your care
            soon.
            <br><br>
            <div style="text-align: right;">
              Love,<br>
              Your Ona-sama
            </div>
          </div>
          <br>
          While I was reading the note, tears came falling down my eyes. I feel more grateful that he wrote this for me, that I almost don’t want
          to leave. Ona-sama slowly pulls me into a serene embrace for the whole five minutes, telling him that I’m forever grateful and in his
          eternal debt as I smile softly in his arms.
          <br><br>
          We pulled ourselves from the embrace after such minutes, him wiping my tears with his cloth. “I guess I’ll see you soon,” I said.
          <br><br>
          “You’re welcome to come back anytime,” he nods, a smile on his face. “And, uh... I’ll get started with the letters tomorrow morning.”
          <br><br>
          “Please do...”
          <br><br>
          The ship sounds its final siren, prompting me to get aboard. From that, I just realized.
          <br><br>
          “Uh... Ona-sama?” I approach him again as soon as he’s about to leave. “There’s actually something that I must give to you before I go.”
          <br><br>
          “Hm?” He wonders about, curious on what it was.
          <br><br>
          I pulled something out from my pocket, hiding between my palm. “May I lend your hand, please?”
          <br><br>
          As soon as he does so, I distinctively hover my hand, dropping an object on his palm. Holding him for the final time, clenching to a fist,
          I slowly muster, “I’ll promise to return here as soon as I’m able to. And when I do, please don’t forget this gift. It’s a sign of our
          everlasting love. Please keep it in a safe place.”
          <br><br>
          What I just gave to him is none other than a ring. A special ring, capable of binding a true relationship between me and Ona-sama. As
          \soon as he wears it on my finger when I return, I’ll forever be bound to him for the rest of my life. In short, I’ll be the most
          beautiful bride on the Venus Island.
          <br><br>
          As I head inside the ship, I quickly get to the balcony to wave everyone goodbyes. I know that I’ll be leaving the island which is my
          second home, so I’ll promise myself to do whatever it takes to come back there and stay... for good.
          <br><br>
          The girls are already heading inside the mansion, but my gaze is still drawn to Ona-sama for some reason. He can’t leave his post until
          he can’t see the ship anymore. Oh, I just wished I didn’t become a Princess so that I could stay with him...
          <br><br>
          <i>A few days later, back at the palace...</i>
          <br><br>
          I’ve been returning to my duties as a Princess after I left the precious island. Tending to the paperwork and to the citizens of the
          kingdom, it felt like a fresh start.
          <br><br>
          But compared to before I entered the island for the first time, I felt... alone. Sure, I have my family here who can cope with my emotions,
          but it just feels like it. Without my dearest Prince, my Ona-sama... I just feel... helpless.
          <br><br>
          Back at the palace, I found some letters addressed from the island. While some of them were from the girls, the majority of them were from
          him. Immediately taking the envelopes, I head to my room to try and read them one by one. Trying to respond to them will take me the course
          of the night, as the package consists of twenty-five letters per day, the highest being at forty-two.
          <br><br>
          Oh, and the telephone line? We don’t have a dedicated service provider to begin with, so it’s not possible to install a telephone line that
          way, unfortunately. I just wrote the final letter to Ona-sama addressing that and other details that he covered.
          <br><br>
          Days gone by, and I’m off to the same routines. Only this time, we’re preparing because next week is my birthday.
          <br><br>
          Do you know that my birthday is on 11 February? No?
          <br><br>
          Anyways, I just sent a bunch of invitational cards to the residents, but I just can’t hamper this feeling. I couldn’t help but feel like I
          wanted to bring him into the fun, too. I decided to write a letter about it, and attached an invitation to my birthday party, including the
          scheduled arrival and departure of the ship that I chose (which for some reason was the ship that was docked at the island during the royal
          visit), inside the envelope. Oh, and I already had the blessing to use the ship for this occasion, so there’s nothing to worry about.
          <br><br>
          <i>Fifteen hours before Fiona’s birthday...</i>
          <br><br>
          Tonight is a long evening at the palace. I head outside to think of what to do when he’s here at the party. Do I have to tell him that I’m
          finally ready to confess about being his bride?
          <br><br>
          I was about to think deeply about it when the courier arrived. “A letter for the Princess,” he said, taking an envelope out of the box.
          <br><br>
          “Thanks for your hard work,” I smile, taking the envelope. “Make sure to sleep well.”
          <br><br>
          “Likewise, your Majesty.”
          <br><br>
          As he left the area, I immediately opened the envelope to reveal a strange flower petal along with a note. It’s one of the flowers that
          only bloom during the eve of a girl’s birthday, the note says.
          <br><br>
          “Wow...” I glance in awe.
          <br><br>
          From afar, the ship sounded its siren, preparing for departure as indicated. One guard approaches my direction: “The ship is ready to
          depart, madame.”
          <br><br>
          “Very well,” I said. “Please welcome him if he gets here.”
          <br><br>
          “Who was it that you’re speaking of?”
          <br><br>
          “My dearest Prince... my Ona-sama.”
          <br><br>
          “Very well.” He said, bowing his head as he left the area. Checking on the petal, it appears to have a stain of white shrouded about in
          gradient colors of purple and pink. It has a distinct fragrant smell, reminding me of the perfume I used before visiting the island for
          the first time.
          <br><br>
          I look up and smile at the glowing moonlight, thinking of the experiences I had with him during my stay. I can’t wait to tell him how
          grateful I am to be his admirer after all. All the sweet memories that we shared together... Ah, it’s finally a dream come true!
          <br><br>
          As I headed to my bedroom, a thought came to mind. “What if after the birthday party, I’ll treat him to a royal date?”
          <br><br>
          I smile as I close my eyes, looking at the shimmering stars across the balcony. I can’t believe I’m going to see him tomorrow! I must
          present myself in the most elegant dress that he’ll be interested in staying for long.
          <br><br>
          But... How about his responsibilities at the island? Surely he can’t just leave them behind because of the party!
          <br><br>
          Oh... What should I do?
          <br><br>
          <i>The next morning (five hours before Fiona’s birthday)...</i>
          <br><br>
          “A package for the Princess,” the courier said, entering the hallway.
          <br><br>
          “Thank you,” I smiled, taking the package. “Any word on the arrival yet?”
          <br><br>
          “Your ship, the S.S. Royal Fiona III, is due to arrive in the next two hours. I got word from the maritime that they’re expecting someone
          from an island off of the Japanese Pacific.”
          <br><br>
          “Thank you. I should get prepared for the party, then.”
          <br><br>
          “Very well. Best wishes on your birthday, your Majesty.”
          <br><br>
          “Thank you,” I bow, carrying the package as I head back to my room. Opening the package reveals a camera, some films, and another note
          that reads:
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> Here are the necessities we need to capture the best memories that we’ll be having
            while at the party. Make sure we utilize it well.
          </div>
          <br>
          As soon as I take the stuff out of the box, I put on my bath towel to do my hour-long bath in preparation for the party.
          <br><br>
          <i>Approximately two hours later...</i>
          <br><br>
          About to finish my endearing hairstyle, I could hear the ship’s siren from afar. It’s returning to dock at the nearest pier! I immediately
          get off the chair to see the ship making a turn with an excitement on my face.
          <br><br>
          “Please, don’t get too excited. Your hairstyle-”
          <br><br>
          “I know! I know,” I slump back to my seat. “I need to look very elegant for him, you know.”
          <br><br>
          “Really?” The handmaiden asks. “Everyone was talking about your relationship with him three days ago.”
          <br><br>
          “They do?” I glance in shock. “W- would that be a problem during the party?”
          <br><br>
          “I don’t think that’s gonna be an issue, though. It seems everyone was really up to supporting your relationship endeavor.”
          <br><br>
          “I see,” I sigh in relief. “Let’s get this done.”
          <br><br>
          Upon finishing the hairstyle, make-up and everything, I quickly set off to the pier to see everyone gathering along there. With guards in
          front of me, they ordered the spectators to get out of the way.
          <br><br>
          Upon proceeding through I could only see the ship... and Lobelia, my childhood friend. “Where is he?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          “He’s... not gonna be here,” she said with a frown on her face.
          <br><br>
          “You’ve got to be kidding me... I did prepare in advance for his arrival, then you said he’s not gonna be here for the party?!”
          <br><br>
          “Y- you have to understand! I-”
          <br><br>
          “I will NOT! We will not begin this party until he’s here, OR at the palace!” I scream, walking away from the crowd as fast as I can.
          <br><br>
          How could he do this to me? He promised! Did he just make a fool out of me by luring my feelings into the brim?
          <br><br>
          “Get out of my way,” I ordered when somebody patted me on the shoulder, not daring to look behind.
          <br><br>
          “Hey!” The stranger called, stopping me in my tracks. Immediately turning my back, I can see a hooded man, handing me something.
          <br><br>
          “Take it,” he said. Slowly but surely, I took his note. He nods slowly, walking away through the crowd. Oh wait, that voice... sounds familiar.
          <br><br>
          I slowly open the note, that reads:
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> Meet me at the palace. You know who this is.
          </div>
          <br>
          Right when I finished reading, trumpets can be heard from the watchtowers of the palace. A guard prompted me to get inside immediately.
          <br><br>
          Upon returning to the palace, I could only see the black hood lying on the floor. Picking it up, my heart started throbbing in fright. “Who
          is he?” I thought to myself.
          <br><br>
          “Guess who?” A voice echoes the hallway.
          <br><br>
          For some reason, it made me feel scared. “Who is it?”
          <br><br>
          “A friend of yours,” the voice replies. It’s making me feel more scared than before.
          <br><br>
          “Please tell me who you are!!!”
          <br><br>
          Silence ensued in the hallway for a few seconds that I was just about to cry in dismay in finding out that I might never see him at the
          party. I just couldn’t help but feel hopeless about this. Everything I worked for for the past week...
          <br><br>
          “Go to the ballroom, and scream his name.”
          <br><br>
          Determined, I nodded and ran to the ballroom just in time for the bells to start chiming. Preparing my breath and my voice, I scream on
          top of my lungs as loud as I can:
          <br><br>
          “Ona-sama!!!”
          <br><br>
          The birds started flying, the waves were crashing, the voices across the kingdom came to a halt. I slump on the ballroom floor, letting
          my tears fall from my eyes as I sob heavily.
          <br><br>
          “Ona-sama... what have I done?”
          <br><br>
          Just as I was about to lay down on the floor, a tall figure approached in my direction, wearing his regal outfit that somehow matches
          the same color as... mine? He slowly pulls me upwards, wiping the tears off my cheek. His gaze and touch felt subtle, until I slowly
          realized who he was.
          <br><br>
          “O- Ona... sama?”
          <br><br>
          As he opened his eyes, the ballroom lights began to lit up like the morning daylight. His soft, supple skin just happened to make me feel
          warm. His charming voice that I missed throughout my life at the island began to bloom as he said the words:
          <br><br>
          “Remember the hood, remember me. Not just as the Owner of the prestigious Venus Island, but also as your Prince.”
          <br><br>
          I smile in awe, immediately wrapping him in an embrace, tears falling off my cheeks as I close my eyes. “Ona-sama... where have you been?”
          <br><br>
          “I just got winded up... You might as well call it an element of surprise,” he giggles softly, continuing to wipe my tears off.
          <br><br>
          I pout, looking at his beautiful face. “Ona-sama!”
          <br><br>
          He chuckles, holding my body close. “Let’s go back to the plaza... everyone is waiting for us there.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah...” I shift away from the embrace, holding his hand as we head out of the ballroom and out of the palace. At the plaza, the King and
          Queen are waiting alongside Lobelia and the invited guests. The spectators began reveling as soon as we approached the red carpet.
          <br><br>
          A teary smile brought upon my face as I walked down the aisle with Ona-sama. It felt like heaven when I’m on his side.
          <br><br>
          As we make our way to the podium, I lead the salutations and a heartwarming message of hope and love to everyone, not to mention the amount
          of support that they gave to me during the times where I have to make the toughest decisions in life.
          <br><br>
          “In addition... I’m forever grateful that I met the sweetest person who will complete my whole life... the one that I could count on during my
          brightest days and darkest nights. Without him, I won’t be where I am right now. I’ll hand over the floor to him for his salutations.”
          <br><br>
          I turn back, gazing at him as I step out of the podium. “Ona-sama?”
          <br><br>
          As he slowly steps on the podium to give his salutations, I just can’t help but hold his hand out of the blue.
          <br><br>
          “Uh...” He chuckles, continuing his salutations. “I just want to thank everyone for welcoming me in advance just so that I can plan this
          surprise. Again, sorry about that, my lady.”
          <br><br>
          “It’s fine,” I chuckle back. “Please proceed.”
          <br><br>
          “Alright... I gotta say, this party, as everyone would know, is for someone who believes that the power of love can mean so much to us... can
          mean more than just heartfelt memories. And with this, I dedicate this toast...” he pauses, raising his wine glass. “... to the woman who
          will be forever grateful to become the most beautiful bride of the kingdom. The one whom I was called the dearest Prince. A toast... to our
          dearest Fiona, as she celebrates her birthday today.”
          <br><br>
          I raise my wineglass while holding his hand. Everyone does the same. Some raised their glass of water, others raised their soft drinks. A
          few raise their mug of morning coffee.
          <br><br>
          “Well then, let’s enjoy the whole day of her birthday party!” The King declared, encouraging everyone to participate as they revel in the
          celebration. I look at the King and Queen as they smile at me. Ona-sama and Lobelia are already on good terms, seemingly because both he
          and I admitted to her about our relationship.
          <br><br>
          “Tell me... When did you really come here?” I turn to gaze at him, waiting for his response.
          <br><br>
          “I gotta tell you, it was three days ago.”
          <br><br>
          “What? B- but how did you slip through without us knowing? You could’ve told me!” I pout.
          <br><br>
          He chuckles. “Ahaha... I got in touch with the tailor who made some distinct hoods so the guards can’t see me. Some residents tend me to
          their delicacies. I have to admit: It’s my first time around here that I have to familiarize myself with everything first before plotting
          the plan.”
          <br><br>
          “Aw, come on! Please don’t do that again, okay? I’ll be upset the next time you do that!”
          <br><br>
          He sighs, kissing my forehead. “I won’t, I promise.”
          <br><br>
          “Just be sure about it!” I sigh, returning my gaze to the crowd as he steps off the podium, proceeding to tend to the guests.
          <br><br>
          Halfway through the party, the King and Queen interrupted the buffet session as they stepped into the centerstage, dancing to the tune of
          their sentimental love songs. Others follow suit, the pairs forming a circle. While Ona-sama glances at the dancers in their regal outfits
          in awe, I feel a bit nervous. Was it really the time to tell him how I really feel during our dance?
          <br><br>
          As the music stops, so are the pairs, gazing at us from our seats. The King requests, “Fiona, dearest?”
          <br><br>
          Ack!
          <br><br>
          He chuckles, rising from his seat, offering me a hand. I couldn’t resist holding him as I stood up as well. “What should I do?” I thought.
          <br><br>
          “Uh... Princess Fiona, may I have this dance?” He asks, looking into my deep purple eyes as they open wide.
          <br><br>
          I hesitate for a bit, looking away, a heavy blush covering my entire face.
          <br><br>
          “Hime... sama?”
          <br><br>
          “I...” I pause, regaining my composure before looking back at his gaze. “You... you shouldn’t be saying that.”
          <br><br>
          As silence ensues in the area, he glances in shock. “What...?”
          <br><br>
          I clear my throat, slowly taking his hand. “I’ll reiterate: Ona-sama... may I have this dance?”
          <br><br>
          As soon as I said that, the <a href="javascript:play()"><span style="color: #d4bfe5;"><b>slow music</b></span></a> started playing,
          awaiting our presence at the centerstage.
          <audio id="playAudio" src="../../media/audio/20210920.mp3" width="0" height="0"></audio>
          <script type="text/javascript">
            function play() {
              document.getElementById("playAudio").play();
            }
          </script>
          <br><br>
          During the course of the performance, everyone watched as Ona-sama and I danced gracefully, staring into each other’s eyes and soul. In an
          unexpected moment, he slowly wipes something off of my cheek.
          <br><br>
          My tears have been falling off during the entire performance that I almost stopped to pull him into an embrace as I cry in joy.
          <br><br>
          At the end of our dance, he was about to take me back to my seat when I pulled his arm, our bodies pulling closer to each other. “Let’s stay
          here,” I softly beg.
          <br><br>
          Slowly, a huge cake is seen entering the centerstage as everyone readies their plates. I smile in delight as the decorations adorned the cake
          resembles the girls from the island!
          <br><br>
          “We prepared the cake just in time,” Lobelia said, assisting with the others on bringing that in. “Misaki knew that your birthday should be
          glamorous, so she worked with the girls to prepare this one ahead of departure.”
          <br><br>
          In appearance, it stood tall at a whopping 86 centimeters, coated in light-purple... the same color as my hair. Diameter: 51cm. Number of
          layers: 6. The decorations: Mini figurines of the girls at the island, and at the top, Ona-sama and I dancing to the tune. For some strange
          reason, the outfits worn in our figurines match what we’re wearing today, while the girls are in their respective one-piece. Sprinkled with
          hearts and stars, and with candles totalling to 11... this is a sight to behold!
          <br><br>
          The King and Queen are on the opposite side, telling everyone to stand up. “Everyone, I would like to extend my gratitude to Princess Fiona
          for her dedication in proving that every moment is worth cherishing for. As we celebrate her birthday, let’s not forget that her adventures
          never end there. Let’s all sing Happy Birthday!”
          <br><br>
          As everyone sang along to the birthday tune, I clung over to his arm, letting my tears fall. I can’t believe that I’ll be celebrating the
          best birthday of my life!
          <br><br>
          As the tune ended, Ona-sama firmly held my hand, preparing himself. “Are you ready?” I nod excitedly, a smile across my face.
          <br><br>
          “Blow the candles!” The Queen said, Ona-sama carrying me by the waist to blow each of the candles. All that’s left is the large candle at
          the top.
          <br><br>
          The guards prepare a platform we can stand on, high enough to reach the top of the cake. I forgot to tell you that the table it’s sitting
          on is kinda high, at approximately 43cm.
          <br><br>
          I was about to lean in when Ona-sama was just watching from where he stood. Holding his hand, I ask: “Hey... can we blow the final candle
          together?”
          <br><br>
          “I, uh... I thought you-”
          <br><br>
          “I know,” I interrupt. “I need you to make a mark as well. You’ll forever be my Prince, and you know that.”
          <br><br>
          “B- but I thought you’re just gonna blow all of the candles? It’s your birthday, you know.”
          <br><br>
          “I know,” I sigh happily. “It may be my birthday, but today also marks our new venture in life... with you as my Prince, and as my boyfriend.”
          <br><br>
          As I say that sentence, everyone stops to see us. He just smiled as he held it firmly. “As you wish, my lady.”
          <br><br>
          Preparing ourselves, we immediately set off to blow the final candle, together. And thus began the day-long birthday celebration like never
          before.
          <br><br>
          <i>That evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          As everyone watches the glowing moonlight, I stand at the palace garden, waiting for his arrival. As he does, I immediately pull him into a
          soft embrace. “I’m so glad you came,” I said happily.
          <br><br>
          “Likewise,” he said, caressing my soft, long hair.
          <br><br>
          I pull myself from the embrace, holding his hand. “So... shall we do it again?”
          <br><br>
          He nods, readying his stance. And so we move along with the music in our ears. The music that played before the celebration even formally began.
          <br><br>
          As we dance to the chorus, I somehow began to sing:
          <br><br>
          “More than just friends we can be, this is what we’re meant to be... I know living my life is not easy, if you ain’t here by my side...”
          <br><br>
          He began singing the other half:
          <br><br>
          “Though I took time to realize, one thing’s true: Look into my eyes... I say there ain’t no one better than you, so please stay right here by
          my side...”
          <br><br>
          As the orchestra syncs in with the tune, fireworks begin popping out from the ship to the skies. While the people watch and amaze the event,
          Ona-sama and I continue to dance in the garden like we don’t mind everyone’s time. I just want to stay with him, no matter what.
          <br><br>
          As the fireworks continued to pop, sparkles forming a shape of two red hearts began lighting up the skies, watching over us as the searchlights
          across the garden illuminate in light-purple.
          <br><br>
          I slump my head on his chest as we continue to dance. “For once in a lifetime, I dreamt of nothing like this... Simple, but elegant; and with my
          precious Prince.”
          <br><br>
          He smiles as I close my eyes, slowly putting us down on the grass. I slowly open my eyes, meeting his gaze. “Why’d you stop?”
          <br><br>
          “You appear tired,” he said, tending to my gown.
          <br><br>
          “Ahaha...” I chuckle as I hold him close. “I mean... I don’t have much of a choice, do I?”
          <br><br>
          He smiles, letting me sleep in his lap. “Tonight is the best night of my life... not only do I get to celebrate my birthday, but I also get the
          chance to be yours, truly. I really, really mean it,” I add.
          <br><br>
          The sparkles never stop illuminating as the fireworks come to an end after eight straight minutes. The lights have faded out, and only the
          music from one of the speakers is playing on loop.
          <br><br>
          “You know... we should do this every night,” I said, caressing his hands. He chuckles softly, still tending to my hair.
          <br><br>
          “You know that we have some responsibilities to do, right?”
          <br><br>
          “I know... but I can’t shake off this feeling of love, now that you’re already here beside me.”
          <br><br>
          I broke into a long yawn. “I think we should head to sleep. I know you’re tired as well as I am.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah,” he said, slumping his body against the grass. He touches my cheeks for the last time of the night. “Goodnight, Hime-sama.”
          <br><br>
          As we both close our eyes, holding hands, I smile as I mutter:
          <br><br>
          “Goodnight... my precious Ouji-sama.”
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          <i>This part of the Inside Story takes place a few months after the Epilogue of Venus Island Diaries - Main Story.</i>
          <br><br>
          <b>POV: Owner</b>
          <br><br>
          Taking a look at some of the photos in her photobook, I felt a smile as I just found out about her past relationships, especially with the
          previous Owner. Turning the page to reveal more photos, I can hear the door creaking behind me, a girl approaching with two mugs in her hands.
          <br><br>
          That’s right, I was inside Fiona’s room the whole time. I asked her if I could see her pictures because I might have remembered something.
          <br><br>
          “Ona-sama,” Fiona approaches closer as I turn my back, closing the photobook.
          <br><br>
          “Yeah?”
          <br><br>
          “Let’s talk it out on the table,” she said, handing me a mug. She made the coffee blend herself, a blend of Aloe and Violet.
          <br><br>
          I take a sip. “That’s pretty good,” I said.
          <br><br>
          She smiles, holding her mug as we proceed to the table. “So... anything interesting?”
          <br><br>
          “Pretty much,” I said, pulling something out of my pocket. “Do you still remember telling me last time that you lost a note?”
          <br><br>
          “Oh yes,” she nods. “I can’t find it now that I came back here along with him...”
          <br><br>
          “Alright...” I reveal the note on the table, pushing it to her direction. “This might be the one you’re looking for. I gotta tell you: That’s
          a long text of appreciation, as far as I understood.”
          <br><br>
          As she takes the note, a throb can be heard in her heartbeat. “This is the one! How did you find it?”
          <br><br>
          “I just found it laying around when I was walking along the sidewalks of Fukushima. Tell me, how did you lose that one?”
          <br><br>
          She sips, holding the note closer to her chest. “You see... we got a thunderstorm back home when he was still with us, I think four days after
          the grand party? Either way, we’re forced to stay for longer because of that, and for some reason, I can’t find the note! I guess the strong
          gusts found the note and took it away without me knowing... although that didn’t happen before. The aftermath came, and luckily, no one was hurt.
          But now I can’t find the note, and I’m lost without it.”
          <br><br>
          “You still have him at that time, so I think there’s nothing to worry about... or so I thought.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah... you know what happened next after we came back here,” she sighs. “But still, I won’t forget what he did... to make me happy.”
          <br><br>
          “We all do,” I said, taking my last sip as the mug is almost empty. “I mean, he did so much to make you all happy, at least.”
          <br><br>
          “I suppose you were right,” she takes her last sip, smiling as she gazes into my eyes. “But everything has changed since you arrived. It
          might be different, but I know that you did the same as him. Maybe even more than that... Look at what happened to Nagisa. She’s happy for
          you now.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, I can see that.”
          <br><br>
          She stands up, putting the note inside her drawer. “Since you already changed most of the destinies here at the island, I think it’s fair
          to say that you became everyone’s admirers, not just me.”
          <br><br>
          I chuckle, standing up from my seat to take her mug. “I see.”
          <br><br>
          “So... anything we can do next?”
          <br><br>
          “Hold on... what time is it on your clock?”
          <br><br>
          She looks at the clock. “It’s almost about 5:49pm... why would you ask?”
          <br><br>
          “Perfect timing... I think we should prepare for dinner together with the rest of the girls. I just want you to remember vividly how your
          grand party went.”
          <br><br>
          “I mean, it’s a long preparation... so I don’t know what it will look like.”
          <br><br>
          Immediately, Misaki enters the room. She appears exhausted. “Ona, preparations are almost done.”
          <br><br>
          “Good,” I said, patting her head. “Please don’t be exhausted as much. You’ll need the energy for a later time.”
          <br><br>
          She smiles, looking at Fiona. The two exchange their thumb-ups.
          <br><br>
          “And, uh... Ona, don’t worry about cooking for dinner.”
          <br><br>
          “What?” I shriek. “I was supposed to cook for the night...”
          <br><br>
          <i>That evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          The tables are beautifully aligned to form a star-shaped Sakura, adorned in gradients of light-purple and white. Decorations surround
          the whole area, with vines and LED lights flashing in various light colors. The tables themselves are separated to allow people to get
          in and out of the centerstage. Various dishes are served, along with a few goodies... except for the cake, for some odd reason.
          <br><br>
          All the girls are present as soon as I approach Fiona and Misaki. Looking at the amount of dishes, I appear surprised. “Who made all of
          these?”
          <br><br>
          “It will be Nagisa,” Misaki pointed her finger to her sister who was about to take her seat. “To be honest, I kinda helped her with the
          cooking, too.”
          <br><br>
          “Wait... was that always a thing?”
          <br><br>
          “Actually,” Fiona clings into my arm. “We have been doing it for years. Taking turns on whose girl to do the job, so everyone can participate.”
          <br><br>
          “I see.” I sigh, looking at the dishes. “There’s a lot here.”
          <br><br>
          “We wanted this to be as grand as we want Fiona to intend it,” Misaki nods. “You see, there’s a bunch of veggies and meat going on here...
          including the island’s famous Philippine Adobo.”
          <br><br>
          “A- Adobo?” I shriek.
          <br><br>
          “Yes,” Nagisa stood up, revealing the dish. “Everyone on this island liked the recipe. Despite what happened during the deterioration,
          this will bring us back together like the old days.”
          <br><br>
          “Ah,” I glance in awe.
          <br><br>
          “Admittedly... I met a Filipino during my time in Japan who taught me how to cook Philippine delicacies like this.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s no surprise,” I leaned forward to have a taste. “You’re good! This has a perfect balance of vinegar and soy sauce, and everything
          else is just... awesome.”
          <br><br>
          “Thanks,” she smiles, her hands forming the shape of a heart as she sits down.
          <br><br>
          “Alright, Misaki. Fiona. Both of you, take a seat.” They did as I was told. “Before we begin this feast, I just want to make sure everyone
          is present for tonight.”
          <br><br>
          As I enumerate the girls, I just noticed that the seat to my right is missing somebody. As I inspect closer, “Where’s Tsukushi at?”
          <br><br>
          Tsukushi is known to be gloomy and shy, especially around girls who appear to be Venuses. In case you don’t know, they were referred to
          as the girls here on this island. I’m not quite sure why. Either way, the girls aren’t aware of her disappearance.
          <br><br>
          Misaki immediately lent me an ear and said, “I think she’s rather gloomy as of late, that she doesn’t know what to do. Maybe you can tell
          her to join us, somehow.”
          <br><br>
          “Where is she?”
          <br><br>
          “I think she may be at the Suite,” she suggested.
          <br><br>
          “Alright.” I nod, turning to face the girls. “I’ll be gone for a bit to try and encourage our dear Tsuuku to join us in this feast. Please
          be patient and have yourself some water if you’re thirsty.”
          <br><br>
          As I leave the area, Fiona and Misaki are busy chatting with the rest of the girls about different things. I immediately head over to the
          Suite to find Tsukushi feeling a bit over the weather.
          <br><br>
          “Are you okay?” I ask, assuring her conditions.
          <br><br>
          She appears stuttering for a bit. “U- uh... I’m n- not feeling c- comfortable...”
          <br><br>
          I nod, patting her head. “I know... Is there anything bothering you?”
          <br><br>
          “N- no... I’m just not feeling myself lately...” she slowly gazes at my worried look. “You know how it is.”
          <br><br>
          “Oh...” I observe her appearance. She looks just fine, and her clothing seems comfortable... oh wait. Did she just have the zipper on her
          sweater off?
          <br><br>
          Slowly, I reach for the zippers, looking at her, trying to give her assurance that nothing can go wrong. Slowly, I pull the zipper upwards,
          covering her naked chest. “There, that should do it.”
          <br><br>
          “I...” she immediately zips her sweater down. “I just felt uncomfortable while in this... and what’s worse, I’m naked. I don’t wanna be seen
          like this; anyone might think I’m weird.”
          <br><br>
          I take a deep sigh, heading out of her way. “Wh- where are you going?!” She asks, a worried look on her face.
          <br><br>
          “I’m just heading to the wardrobe, trying to find you something comfortable,” I said, opening the wardrobe full of outfits that deserved
          borrowable. She doesn’t have an adequate number of outfits lately, so I might figure I can make her one when I have time.
          <br><br>
          Tsukushi just watches as I pick which one might suit her taste. “Something comfortable...” I thought to myself. “Ah!”
          <br><br>
          I found another one of Misaki’s Pure White Slit One-Piece. I should’ve renamed it as a White Gala, since this is definitely what a girl
          would wear during such events.
          <br><br>
          Putting the outfit on the bed, I go back to the wardrobe to find some underwear. “Where’s the duplicate of Innocence and Grace? Hm.”
          <br><br>
          Finally found it, I sent them over to Tsukushi, who appeared to be nervous. “You should get changed immediately. I think those might suit
          you, as far as I know,” I said, turning my back to see how the girls were doing on the balcony.
          <br><br>
          As she was looking at the outfits, she appeared to be a little nervous. But not that nervous as before. “Um... Ona-san?”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah?” I immediately turn to respond to her question.
          <br><br>
          “C- can you... dress... for me?”
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          Wait, I have to dress her?
          <br><br>
          A tingling sensation came to my spine as she muttered those words. Is she really that naïve to even say that in the first place?
          <br><br>
          As she readies herself, I slowly walk closer, looking at her with a worried look. “Would... that be alright with you?”
          <br><br>
          She slowly nods, pulling me into a soft embrace. Although she appears gloomy, she’s soft to touch. “I don’t know if I can handle this...
          but I might if I try.”
          <br><br>
          I sigh, slowly pulling from her embrace. “Alright, then. If you feel a little uncomfortable, you can just tell me.”
          <br><br>
          Slowly but surely, I begin the undressing process, starting from her sweater. Slowly pulling the zipper downwards, my head immediately
          flashes back to that one PV where the previous Owner did the same thing, making her feel nervous for some reason.
          <br><br>
          Removing the clip that holds the zipper, she then instructs to take the shirt off, revealing her naked chest. I couldn’t have been more
          flushed other than this scene.
          <br><br>
          She slowly stands up, taking off her belt. “This one, too. I have to tell you... I don’t wear any panties.”
          <br><br>
          Okay, this is getting out of hand.
          <br><br>
          Slowly, I pull her shorts downwards, trying to look away at her bottom. When that is off, I turn over to the bed to locate the underwear.
          <br><br>
          Tsukushi, for some odd reason, cups my face as I tend to the underwear, trying to let me gaze into her naked body. “Why are you looking
          away?”
          <br><br>
          “I... I don’t know.”
          <br><br>
          “Aren’t you interested to see my body?”
          <br><br>
          “N- no! I mean, we have to hurry; the girls are waiting for us.”
          <br><br>
          <i>A good several minutes of struggling to handle Tsukushi later...</i>
          <br><br>
          Slowly turning to see her figure, she appears more elegant than ever. The White Gala does its job right, and I know that because the
          others tried that on as well. “How do I look?” Tsukushi asked.
          <br><br>
          “You look pretty elegant with that outfit,” I said, summoning the mirror. From there, a smile formed on her face.
          <br><br>
          “I look... beautiful!”
          <br><br>
          We head back outside to see the girls fully ready for dinner. Tsukushi sat right next to me, as I remained standing to give my salutations.
          <br><br>
          “Here we are. Last week has been tough for some of you to cope with. Telling stories that reshape your destinies. And despite our
          struggles, we became closer in each passing moment. Tonight marks a new milestone in bringing the faith in ourselves. As we look forward
          to the new moment passing by, let’s not forget the things we did that brought us here to our tables. I would like to extend my gratitude
          to you all for taking care of yourselves and ourselves. To Fiona, whom some of us look highly to... tonight, we remember what your best day
          would be like.”
          <br><br>
          As I clasp my hands together to send my prayers, Fiona smiles softly, a little moved by my words.
          <br><br>
          “So, let’s all enjoy the buffet and be full; we’ll hold a ball after this feast.”
          <br><br>
          I turn to Misaki as I slump in my seat. “Looks like you did it.”
          <br><br>
          “No...” She shakes her head. “We did it.”
          <br><br>
          I chuckle at the response, letting her enjoy the feast as I reassure Tsukushi’s condition before she can eat her dish. On her plate were
          an assortment of seafood, hand-picked by Nagisa the chef. In addition: Some eggs and fries, and her preferred energy drink.
          <br><br>
          As she tends to her meal, I prepare some water to keep everyone hydrated. As I circle around to tend to the glasses, I just happen to
          step on a strange object. Picking it up, the item reveals itself as a hairpin with an ornament dangling on the end. It appears to be
          slightly used, as the colors are much glossy like new. I kept the item in my pocket just in case I needed it for later.
          <br><br>
          When everyone has their share of water, I begin eating my dish. Aside from the famous Philippine Adobo, I have three slices of Hawaiian
          pizza with pineapples on top, Japanese sushi with broccoli, and a Japanese manjū coated in chocolate and hazelnuts. Nagisa handled the
          dishes very well.
          <br><br>
          <i>A few minutes of enjoying the meal later...</i>
          <br><br>
          I was about to finish my meal when Fiona was already on the centerstage, clearing her throat. “Everyone, can I have your attention, please?”
          <br><br>
          Feeling a bit thirsty, I begin to drink another glass of water... when Fiona captures my attention. “Ona-sama?”
          <br><br>
          I immediately stopped drinking to focus on her attention. “Uh- yes?”
          <br><br>
          “Um...” she slowly approaches in my direction, offering me a hand. “May I have this dance?”
          <br><br>
          As she mustered those words, I felt my heartbeat becoming a little faster. Is she trying to tell me to dance with her with the other
          girls watching us from all directions? Or...
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          ... did she do it to remember what could have been her best moment in her life?
          <br><br>
