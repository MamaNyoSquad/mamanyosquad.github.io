          <b>POV: Owner</b>
          <br><br>
          It’s Saturday evening. I was about to finish my paperwork when I heard panic downstairs. Misaki and Sayuri raced upstairs
          as soon as I got out of the Suite. “Ona-san, we have a problem,” said Sayuri, appearing exhausted.
          <br><br>
          “What’s going on?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          “Alright, I just had a problem with one of our electrical systems and that needs to be fixed immediately,” Misaki said,
          handing over the note. it reads:
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> We got a problem with the electrical systems. Best to fix them
            immediately before that gets worse.
          </div>
          <br>
          “This is bad,” I said, sighing. “I might not be the only one who can provide that expertise, though.”
          <br><br>
          “Could you think there’s another that might help you with that?” Sayuri asks, a little nervous.
          <br><br>
          “I don’t know, but I’ll see what I can do,” I said, patting their heads.
          <br><br>
          They both nod, returning to their rooms. I went back to the Suite, only to see the lights flicker around the room. “That’s
          bad.”
          <br><br>
          In some short milliseconds, the bulbs stopped lighting; and only the moonlight can be provided for the night. We just had a
          blackout.
          <br><br>
          Immediately using my flashlight, I begin my way out. Some girls got out of their rooms in fear of the dark, and they somehow
          found me there. “Ona-sama, what’s happening?!” Fiona asked in a nervous tone.
          <br><br>
          I softly pat her back, telling her to calm down. “Just take a deep breath and everything will be fine. I’ll explain everything
          when we’re outside.”
          <br><br>
          As soon as everyone is outside, I begin my remarks: “Alright ladies, we just had a blackout; alternatively, people call it a
          power outage. This is fairly uncommon since it’s our first time having this kind of problem. But if we work together just like
          what we did in the toughest situations, I’m sure we can alleviate that issue in no time at all.”
          <br><br>
          I clear my throat before proceeding to the next sentence. “We know that some of you have their expertise ranging from their
          capability to fight up to handling the machinery. So I think it’s a good idea to share those expertise to others so that everyone
          can participate. What do you say?”
          <br><br>
          They all nod at my sentiments.
          <br><br>
          “Very good,” I said. “So, I might need someone to help me with this issue and hopefully bring back the operations as fast as
          possible.”
          <br><br>
          Someone behind them is raising her hand as soon as I finish saying that sentence. “Can we have her in the front, please?”
          <br><br>
          Slowly, I begin to realize who that woman was as soon as she walks close. “Luna...”
          <br><br>
          She stops to gaze at my direction, still maintaining that same neutral look. By appearance, she wears an Alien Heart. “Yes, I
          tend to fix stuff sometimes.”
          <br><br>
          “Quite a curiosity. Okay, we need to help each other on this one. But first, we need to figure out if that can be fixed in no time
          at all.”
          <br><br>
          Immediately setting out to the back of the mansion, we enter the electrical room, which already has a lot of smoke. “What happened
          here?” I ask, coughing.
          <br><br>
          With the flashlight in hand, we begin to inspect the machinery. “Those were the old electrical stuff that still managed to run
          after several years,” said Luna. “The only major damage was that it got hit by weapons and debris when Omega raided this island.”
          <br><br>
          “Ah,” I realize. We could only fix some parts, but not everything because they got some major damages here and there, with the
          significance being the chaos. And besides, those were pretty old, too. We could invest in a new one of the same equivalent, but from
          what I heard a few years ago, those were very expensive. I’m not sure how the previous Owner managed to buy that one. Or maybe he
          didn’t, and this island was built WAY before he came here for the first time.
          <br><br>
          ... maybe Zack did have these electronics before? It’s kinda evident by the fact that he had his own island (Zack Island) that he spent
          a whole lot of figures to get the electronics working.
          <br><br>
          As we inspected further, we noticed some leakages laying about on the floor. “Oil is used to power the island,” she said. “While
          there’s no smell when everything’s normal, there is when there’s a malfunction. And when it does, it smells horrible.”
          <br><br>
          “Damn. We need to get rid of this.”
          <br><br>
          “How do we do that?”
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          “I got an idea.”
          <br><br>
          With the others already having their cleaning materials, we set out to clean the mess inside the electrical room. And that includes
          the oil leakages.
          <br><br>
          A few minutes later, and it looks like we got rid of it. “What’s next?” Asked Momiji.
          <br><br>
          “I’ve already made a decision. Since this machine is very old and is already somewhat beyond repair after years of service despite the
          chaos, I’ve finally decided that we have to retire this machine. Just look at the leakage.”
          <br><br>
          “But, will there be an alternative for that?” Monica taps my shoulder. “I mean, we couldn’t possibly just leave it at that, right? I
          mean, no power and all...”
          <br><br>
          “No problem. By tomorrow morning, I’ll get in touch with some of my friends who work at an electronics firm, making tools that mainly
          utilize renewable energy.”
          <br><br>
          “Would that even work?” Sweetie Helena asks. “I saw a bunch while I was on an expedition with Marie Rose, but we haven’t got to utilize
          them at DOATEC.”
          <br><br>
          “They will. Since we do have a slight amount of rainfall every year, the sunlight can play a role in powering this precious island for
          years to come. All we need is a spot to place those arrays of cells.”
          <br><br>
          “What about the Nikki Beach, where we placed a bunch of flags last time?” Fiona asks, recalling that time when we’re just preparing for
          Nyotengu’s birthday. <b><i>For reference, see Admirant of the Future.</i></b>
          <br><br>
          “I don’t think that’s necessary,” I said. “The main requirement for solar panels is that there’s sunlight in every angle. Which means
          that if one is blocked off on the other side, there’s higher chances that it will not receive any sunlight. The Nikki Beach has one
          side blocked by a wall of rocks, so...”
          <br><br>
          “I see,” Fiona nods at that sentiment.
          <br><br>
          “It’s best that we discuss this matter in the morning. For now, let’s get rid of this.”
          <br><br>
          Working together, we had an opportunity to move the machinery out of the area, albeit with a few breaks. “I might go stiff after this
          one,” whines Momiji.
          <br><br>
          “You’ll be fine. I’ll give you some massage after this,” I chuckled as we left the area. “Let’s just leave that there for the meantime.
          Open your window sills to allow air to pass through.”
          <br><br>
          As we head inside the mansion, Luna can be seen tending to her arms. It’s her first time carrying such heavy equipment, and they made
          her very dizzy. Immediately carrying her figure, I follow Momiji into her room as my next task will be the massage.
          <br><br>
          As I lay down Luna’s body onto Momiji’s bed, I feel a little bit concerned about what happened. Did I just make them overdo it?
          <br><br>
          “She’ll be alright,” Momiji clings on my shoulder.
          <br><br>
          “But I shouldn’t let you do that in the first place,” I said, frowning as I gaze at the floor. “I mean, we should just fix it while we
          can-”
          <br><br>
          “It’s not a problem,” she interrupts. “And besides, it’s for the greater good. Just imagine the pungent smell that that machine gave
          off... that might give anyone an aneurysm.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, I think you’re right.”
          <br><br>
          As I did my massages, Luna’s eyes slowly lit up. “Where am I... ?”
          <br><br>
          “Just stay right there, I’ll tend to you after this one.”
          <br><br>
          After I massaged Momiji, it’s Luna’s turn to have the same treatment.
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          Luna’s stomach just groans. “I’m hungry...”
          <br><br>
          <i>The next morning...</i>
          <br><br>
          Luna, Misaki, Monica and Helena are waiting for me at the café as I approach close, my phone in hand. “Good morning,” I greet with a
          smile on my face.
          <br><br>
          “Good morning,” the girls stand up and greet simultaneously, a smile on their faces.
          <br><br>
          Helena pulls me into a soft embrace. “How’s your sleep, sweetie?”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, I’m good.”
          <br><br>
          “In that case, we got the notes ready.” said Luna, her notepad on the table.
          <br><br>
          Slowly, I release myself from the embrace, immediately dialing the number. “This should take a while.”
          <br><br>
          Speaking on the other line is indeed my friends who work at that firm. Since our plan is to replace the machinery that is responsible
          for electricity, they suggested that I should invoke a mini solar power plant. With Luna taking down notes, they expressed how many
          solar cells and wattages needed to power up a single island 24/7.
          <br><br>
          “We should also suggest that since your island has a volcano, maybe you should try your hand at geothermal,” one worker said on the line.
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, we have; but it’s been dormant.”
          <br><br>
          “That doesn’t mean it doesn’t emit something,” he said. “We’ll come here if we have time, but for now, we’ll provide you with the solar
          panels as requested.”
          <br><br>
          “Thanks.”
          <br><br>
          <i>The next couple of hours...</i>
          <br><br>
          The activities continue like normal, except that the girls are somewhat concerned about the blackout. Some of them were pretty anxious
          as refrigeration is inoperable.
          <br><br>
          Meanwhile, I was about to enter the room when I saw Luna sleeping on the bed. Trying to wake her up would be out of the question, as I
          might disturb her good night sleep.
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          ... except that it isn’t evening yet.
          <br><br>
          Out of curiosity, I switched on the lampshade to see if there’s anything operable right now, and it lit up in an instant! “What...” I
          thought to myself.
          <br><br>
          Forcing Luna to wake up, I hurried to turn the kitchen lights on. But there’s no sign of power whatsoever. What’s going on?
          <br><br>
          “Could it be that her Alien Heart is the one powering up a room when she’s inside and asleep?” I thought deeply about it. Going back
          to the Suite, Luna is already up; the bad news is that the power of that lampshade has been cut off.
          <br><br>
          “Ona-san,” Luna holds my hand. “Did something happen to me?”
          <br><br>
          “No, uh...” I answer with a confused look on my face. “Sorry for waking you up.”
          <br><br>
          “No problem... can I please have your moment? I need to tell you something secret.”
          <br><br>
          That’s strange considering that I just knew what’s going on. Regardless, I sit beside her. “Sure, what is it?”
          <br><br>
          Slowly, she places my hands against her chest, a faint glow emanating from her outfit. “I have to tell you something about this outfit...
          since I wore it for the time being, I was subject to weird things that only I can understand. They usually happen when I sleep--I don’t
          know if they could affect how I live here.”
          <br><br>
          “Such as?”
          <br><br>
          “... I just heard you clicking the lampshade minutes ago,” she looks at me, appearing curious. “How did it go?”
          <br><br>
          “The bulb was turned on,” I said.
          <br><br>
          At this point, she just sighs, my hands still in her chest. “So it seems. It gave me the ability to light up a room during my sleep.”
          <br><br>
          “... would that affect how you interact with the others?”
          <br><br>
          “I don’t know,” she shakes her head. “I mean, they sometimes call me weird, so I guess that might be the case.”
          <br><br>
          “I see.”
          <br><br>
          “Could you please keep them a secret for me?” She pleads in a soft tone. “I’ll tell them everything when the time comes.”
          <br><br>
          I nod without hesitation. “Your secret is safe with me.”
          <br><br>
          <i>That night...</i>
          <br><br>
          “It looks like everyone’s asleep,” I thought to myself upon checking the rooms. Going back to the Suite, Luna is tending to her outfit,
          wondering if she could at least see its capabilities.
          <br><br>
          “Ona-san, can you please film what you’re doing so that I can take a look at what happened?”
          <br><br>
          “Sure,” I said, bringing out my camera. Luna tries her best to sleep so that her abilities can activate in full bloom. As a precaution,
          I left the lights off as I set up the camera.
          <br><br>
          I’m about to turn the camera on when it turns off immediately. A couple of tries later and still the same result. “It must be out of
          batteries,” I thought.
          <br><br>
          Turning the lampshade on, I proceed to find its charger. Luna is still fast asleep.
          <br><br>
          Plugging in the charger reveals that the camera is on full battery. “What’s going on?”
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          Then, I heard a soft voice telling me, “Please, don’t do it.”
          <br><br>
          “Uh, who?”
          <br><br>
          Someone taps on my shoulder, so soft that I barely notice. “It’s me.”
          <br><br>
          “Who was it?” I turn back. Revealed in front of me is a woman who looks like Luna, but with a different hair color. She wears the same
          Alien Heart.
          <br><br>
          She approaches closer to me until we’re a few centimeters away. “Could you please do me a favor and protect Luna with your own life?”
          <br><br>
          “Did something happen to her?”
          <br><br>
          “I don’t know what had caused her to act like this, but she’s in trouble. She’s at risk of being in complete hibernation.”
          <br><br>
          “But... how can you walk around?”
          <br><br>
          “As soon as she sleeps, I wake up from her body,” the spirit said. She sounds just like Luna, albeit a bit softer on that part. “And
          from there, I can wander around without anybody noticing.”
          <br><br>
          “Oh.”
          <br><br>
          “I know what you’ve been thinking: Do you want to find out the true cause of the blackout?”
          <br><br>
          “I mean, from what I’ve seen, there’s a lot of malfunction and leakage there.”
          <br><br>
          “No... there isn’t.” She shakes her head, gazing at the floor with a frown on her face. “I was at fault for what happened.”
          <br><br>
          “Could you please tell me more about it? Maybe I’ll try my best to help-”
          <br><br>
          “It can’t be helped,” she interrupts. “There’s no turning back from what happened.”
          <br><br>
          “Just please tell me about it,” I beg. “I may not provide any assistance, but I’m sure here to heed to your sentiments.”
          <br><br>
          “...”
          <br><br>
          I listened carefully as the spirit expressed her sentiments, from how she managed to manifest inside Luna’s body, to the blackout. We
          talked for hours until she’s completely exhausted.
          <br><br>
          “That’s all you need to know,” she said, wrapping up the long rant. “What would be the next step is on you. But do me a favor and take
          care of your precious Luna like you did to everyone else.”
          <br><br>
          I nod, holding her hand.
          <br><br>
          “I know I could count on you,” she smiles softly, almost like she’s going to cry. “Be a good Ouji-sama to her, okay?”
          <br><br>
          “But how about you?”
          <br><br>
          “Don’t worry about me, because I’ll always be watching over you. Hopefully you can see me in my true form soon.”
          <br><br>
          I nod, sighing as she disappears in a glow of light. I know there’s some oddity going on, but...

          ...
          <br><br>
          ... if I’m to choose which path to tackle, it will be something that will benefit everyone. Even if that means I have to sacrifice myself,
          yet again.
          <br><br>
          <i>That morning...</i>
          <br><br>
          “The solar cells are here,” reprimanded Misaki, who just came back from the pier. “Where should we put them?”
          <br><br>
          “I’ll take care of it,” I said, heading to the pier after that response. From a distance, Luna is waiting patiently for me. “How are you,
          Luna?”
          <br><br>
          “I’m good, Ona-san,” she said, cupping my cheeks. “I assume you didn’t record what happened last night.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, sorry about that.”
          <br><br>
          “Don’t worry about it,” she smiles. “I’m sure the spirit residing within this swimsuit just told you about what happened.”
          <br><br>
          “Will they be aware of it?”
          <br><br>
          “Like I said, they’ll know about it later. Now, let’s get going.”
          <br><br>
          Tending to the panels, I immediately sketched up a plan on where to place them. As soon as I did, I started placing them in their
          respective spots. I could feel the spirit lingering in me as Luna smiled in the distance.
          <br><br>
          <i>That evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          “Everyone went to sleep,” I thought, checking up on the rooms. I’m three quarters done with the solar panels and the electronics needed
          to power the island. “Now where is she... ?”
          <br><br>
          Slowly, the spirit clings to his shoulder. “I’m right here!”
          <br><br>
          “Ah!”
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          “So you’re almost done with the electricity,” she said, gazing at the night sky. We’re sitting at the rooftop of the mansion as she firmly
          holds my hand.
          <br><br>
          “Yeah,” I sighed. “It took me hours of work to get everything done.”
          <br><br>
          “I’m sure you can do it,” she beams at me. Slowly, her smile turned into a frown.
          <br><br>
          “Is... something wrong?”
          <br><br>
          “...” She kept silent for a moment, raising her arms. “Hug me. Please hug me as tight as you could.”
          <br><br>
          I nod, pulling her into a tight embrace, closing my eyes.
          <br><br>
          “I’ll... I’ll miss you so much... even if we met for just a couple of days... I will never forget this.”
          <br><br>
          “I know, I’ll miss you too.”
          <br><br>
          The spirit softly sobs behind my nape, her tears lingering on my back. I know that she’ll not be around once the process is complete, and
          that I should cherish what we had while it lasts.
          <br><br>
          “I... I don’t know if you’re still aware of this, but... I can still get to see you.”
          <br><br>
          “What? How would you do that?”
          <br><br>
          She smiles at me, wiping her tears off her cheeks. “It’s simple: The Alien Heart’s pendant.”
          <br><br>
          That pendant... the one with the animated heart?
          <br><br>
          “Uh-oh. It looks like my time has come,” said the spirit. “Goodbye, Ona-sama.”
          <br><br>
          “Hey, wait!!!” I somehow grabbed her hand before she stood up. “Uh... what’s your name?”
          <br><br>
          “I... I don’t really have a name,” she said, her smile still emanating on her face. “But since I reside in Luna’s swimsuit, then I’m to be
          called...”
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          She doesn’t really have a name, Luna told me a few hours ago. I could vaguely remember that she does have the same figure as Luna’s to some
          extent, but I’m still not quite sure.
          <br><br>
          “... Lauena.”
          <br><br>
          I smiled upon realizing that. “Then it’s nice to finally meet you... Lauena.”
          <br><br>
          “What’s your name, Ona-sama? Do you have one?”
          <br><br>
          “I’m...”
          <br><br>
          To be honest, I haven’t told anyone about my real name just yet. Everyone just calls me the Owner and leaves it at that... except Helena,
          though. A year after Omega’s mess she finally knew who I was, and she embraced it even after the day we wed and became an official couple.
          <br><br>
          After a consecutive amount of sighs, I finally took the time to say it to Lauena.
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          “My name... is Mike Cruz.”
          <br><br>
          As she disappears into a sheer amount of light, I’ve finally learned to value her as I did to others... and to my wife. Upon diminishing,
          the same pendant can be found below me, the heart animated in colors of pink and light-blue.
          <br><br>
          Picking it up, I held the pendant as tight as I could, closing my eyes. “Lauena... I’ll always remember this.”
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          “The panels!” I thought, looking at the remaining solar panels down below. “If I really want to finish it as quickly as possible then I
          have to do it now.”
          <br><br>
          With the little power I have left, I began working on the remaining panels as indicated in the blueprint, still carrying the same pendant
          with me. Setting up the remaining wires, I’m about to finally power the main line up when I saw the connecting holes on the front.
          <br><br>
          Looking at the pendant, I just saw the plugs rising from the pendant as the display seemed to deactivate. “It knows where to plug itself
          into,” I thought, and without hesitation, I plugged in the pendant. It glows for a minute, then displays the same heart animation as before.
          <br><br>
          Sighing deeply, I’m about to power the panel on. “Lauena, welcome to your new home.” Slowly raising the handle upwards, I can feel the
          energy flowing from the panel as it makes its way through the wires and into the devices across the rooms. The windows automatically close,
          the air conditioners are running, and the lights are indeed on.

              tunnel, marking a new beginning after every struggle. And today is a new beginning of our new norm of appreciation.

          <i>The next morning...</i>
          <br><br>
          Everyone woke up to a good night’s sleep, knowing that they have their ventilation back. At the Suite, Luna woke up beside me and Helena,
          but was shocked upon knowing that the pendant that was once on her Alien Heart outfit was gone.
          <br><br>
          “Ona-san... where is the pendant?” Asked Luna. I just smile.
          <br><br>
          “You see,” I place my hand on her shoulder. “She’s at her new home.”
          <br><br>
          She closes her eyes, beaming back at me. “Ah, so it seems that she has already found a new friend she can rely on. I’m grateful that it’s
          you that she met.”
          <br><br>
          I nod. “So, are you ready to continue working?”
          <br><br>
          “Of course,” she pulls me into an embrace. “And, I’ll bring up the revelation this afternoon.”
          <br><br>
          “Alright,” I gently pat her head. “Hopefully you should be alright.”
          <br><br>
          “I definitely hope so,” she said, sighing heavily. It seemed noticeable that her condition slowly became worse.
          <br><br>
          “I... I think you might need to take a rest for a while,” I said, carrying her to bed. Her face is sunken, and her body becomes stiff.
          <br><br>
          Slowly waking up, Helena gazes at the weakened Luna. “Is... she alright?”
          <br><br>
          “I probably hope so,” I said, saddened about the situation. Tending to her skin, I felt no pulses coming from her as her eyelids were closed.
          <br><br>
          Oh no.
          <br><br>
          “Helena! Call Sayuri immediately!” I scream, catching her attention.
          <br><br>
          <i>A few minutes later...</i>
          <br><br>
          “She’s not feeling well,” Sayuri revealed the results, her face sunken. “I don’t think she might be able to wake up at this time.”
          <br><br>
          “So that’s what Lauena told me the other day...” I said in a soft, pitiful voice; tears were about to fall from my eyes. “I’m very sorry... I
          failed you, Luna.”
          <br><br>
          “Who’s Lauena?” Helena asks me with a curious look on her face.
          <br><br>
          I sighed, closing my eyes. “She’s... she is Luna’s spirit, used to live inside her Alien Heart. She’s the one who caused the blackout.”
          <br><br>
          “B-but she might not be the one who caused it in the first place, does she?” Sayuri expresses her concern. “I mean, Momiji just told me about
          the malfunction of the machine and the bad smell it gave off, right?”
          <br><br>
          “She made it worse, thus the blackout,” I said. “The only saving grace during that period is if I took care of Luna and sort out this problem
          immediately. But at the end of the day, I could only get to talk to Lauena, and not to Luna.”
          <br><br>
          “I’m very sure she knew you still cared about her,” said Honoka, wearing the same Alien Heart as Luna’s but with its own pendant. “Just like
          you did to your wife and the rest of us.”
          <br><br>
          I slowly nod upon realizing what I did in the past and how it carried over up to this day. “I’ve made a decision: Let’s hold a monthly
          commemoration to Lauena, starting tomorrow night.”
          <br><br>
          “But how about the Festival?” asked Misaki.
          <br><br>
          “We won’t be doing anything starting today in preparation for the commemorative event. You girls take your time to prepare, while Sayuri,
          Helen and I tend to Luna during her hibernation.”
          <br><br>
          She nods. “I’ll tell that to others right away.”
          <br><br>
          “Thanks.”
          <br><br>
          <b>POV: Misaki</b>
          <br><br>
          As I got out of the mansion to tell the girls about the situation, Nagisa and Fiona were tending to the back, somewhat curious about the
          quiet noise. “Nagisa! Fiona!” I call for their names.
          <br><br>
          “Ah, sis,” mustered Nagisa. “I was just curious about what happened here. I can no longer hear any machinery.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, about that. Ona just told me that we’ll hold a monthly commemorative event starting tomorrow night,” I said, handing a water tumbler.
          <br><br>
          “And how about the Festival?” Asks Fiona, who seems to be pretty excited about the upcoming Festival Event.
          <br><br>
          I shake my head in disbelief. “Unfortunately, there will be no Festivals today in preparation for the commemoration.”
          <br><br>
          “Did... something happen?”
          <br><br>
          I sigh deeply on that question. “I’ll tell you about it when we get to the café. Until then, let’s get going.”
          <br><br>
          <b>POV: Lauena</b>
          <br><br>
          As I tended to the main panel, my body felt stiff. I could just hear the waning sounds of conversation. “Luna... are you alright?”
          <br><br>
          I slump my whole weight on the ground, my tears letting out as I cry softly, my head on my knees. “Ona-sama... please save your precious Luna...
          please save her for my sake.”

          <b>POV: Sayuri</b>
          <br><br>
          Back at the Suite, I was just about to check up on Luna when the power went out again. “Again?” I shriek. “B-but I thought we already had
          the solar panels ready to go.”
          <br><br>
          “I’ll go take a look,” said Ona-chan, who was just inches away from the room.
          <br><br>
          “Please be careful,” Helena and I said simultaneously.
          <br><br>
          As he left the area, Helena firmly held my hand, beaming at me. “Now I know why he cared about you very well.”
          <br><br>
          “Aw come on,” I giggle, patting her head. “It’s all thanks to him... and to you. I might have to reiterate: I can see why he cared about us
          as much as he did to you.”
          <br><br>
          “Oh?”
          <br><br>
          “And now, we’re taking care of this poor girl. I mean, she had enough willpower to stay for the Roasted Sweet Potatoes rather than to
          complete her research.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah... she told me that the other day.”
          <br><br>
          <b>POV: Helena</b>
          <br><br>
          <i>Seven years and two months since Ona-san came to the island...</i>
          <br><br>
          I somehow encountered Luna by the aisle as she fidgeted with her hands. “Luna?” I called her.
          <br><br>
          “Yes, Helena-san?” She responds in a polite manner. How many times has she done that since she first came to the island, I’m guessing?
          <br><br>
          “I was just wondering... how about your research on this island? I haven’t seen you doing that in a while. Is there a problem, or are you
          already ending that as a whole?”
          <br><br>
          “I’ve finally decided that I won’t be doing research anymore because I’ve known everything thanks to dear Ona-san. Also, I’ve given up my
          status as a Scholar.”
          <br><br>
          “That for a pair of Roasted Sweet Potatoes?”
          <br><br>
          She nods in agreement. “When I think of those delicacies, I always think of what path I should take next, no matter if it’s hard. Knowing
          that this will be for his sake, I took the hardest one, giving up everything I had.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s... quite a metaphor you had there.”
          <br><br>
          “It’s not just a metaphor, it’s a realization. Sometimes, the answers are right there in front of you. You just have to prepare your body
          and mind, and embrace it.”
          <br><br>
          I nod my head, agreeing to her sentiment.
          <br><br>
          As we watch the sunset, she gently holds my hand. “I can see why he also cared about you, albeit by a lot.”
          <br><br>
          “Oh Luna,” I chuckle. “I guess he did that because he wants to give me the same value as you and the others, nothing special. Although I
          might’ve prepared my emotions for something else.”
          <br><br>
          “Oh?”
          <br><br>
          “I don’t know if I told anyone about this, but I think I’ve developed... feelings... for him.”
          <br><br>
          Luna’s eyes opened wide. “Seriously?”
          <br><br>
          “I think so,” I smile. “But, if Nyotengu wishes to have him more than I do, then-”
          <br><br>
          “Hey, I’ve seen your chemistry with him for a long time. And so did Nyotengu. And so did the others, especially Nagisa and I. But if we
          can agree on one thing, it’s that despite you still holding your position as the Head of DOATEC, you managed to get through the struggles
          to at most take care of him and put your status on the line for his sake.”
          <br><br>
          “I suppose, but I wasn’t the one who had everything on the line for his sake. It was him who had everything on a thin line for ours and
          the island’s sake. It already feels like a precious home to him.”
          <br><br>
          “Agreed.”

          “... and then, when everyone knew about my intimacy with him, they congratulated me for it. I think it’s you who were first in line,”
          Helena said, gazing at me with a smile on her face. “Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.”
          <br><br>
          “Hey, don’t worry about it. If you really loved him then there’s nothing standing in your way.”
          <br><br>
          “I guess you’re right. But, he cared for us as much as he did to Luna. And now we’re returning the favor by equally caring for each other.”
          <br><br>
          As he comes back with the strange pendant in his hand, he leans over to place the pendant in its slot. “Luna, she’s home.”
          <br><br>
          Immediately, Luna’s body glows in colors of sky-blue and pink. It became so bright that we decided to stand back. “What’s happening?!”
          <br><br>
          But, Ona-san was just sitting there, holding her hand as he closed his eyes. The voice can be heard across the horizon, saying: “You have
          granted my wish that I wanted to take on for a long time. And now, I’ve awoken from my slumber. It’s all thanks to you, Mr. Cruz. Without
          you, Lauena wouldn’t have stayed in her new home. Make sure to treat her well as you did to the others... and someday, we might meet again.
          But it’s goodbye for now, as I head to another place. I’ll leave her to your capable hands.”
          <br><br>
          “Who’s that?” I shriek.
          <br><br>
          “No idea,” Helena said, holding my hand.
          <br><br>
          As the glow subsides, the pendant can be seen removed from its place. The lampshade is powered on, as well as other equipment. “What’s
          going on here?” I wander around, Helena following my direction.
          <br><br>
          Down below, the girls can be seen wondering what happened at the Suite. Honoka, still wearing the same swimsuit as Luna’s, sat there as
          she watched from the poolside. The others? Well, they’re scattered about as they hear the voice.
          <br><br>
          The lampshade and equipment went off again as Luna woke up from her slumber. “What’s... going on?” She asked.
          <br><br>
          “Lauena...” I wonder. “Who definitely is she?”
          <br><br>
          Luna knew that her time had come to unveil the secret of the Alien Heart. Honoka races to the Suite to confirm her theory since she wore
          the same outfit as hers.
          <br><br>
          “Is she... an alien who gave you the outfit in the first place?” Asked Honoka.
          <br><br>
          “She’s not, but her close family is. Lauena resides within my Alien Heart,” Luna said, holding her hand.
          <br><br>
          “So she’s one of those who is rumored to act just like us Venuses?” Asked Helena as she and I slowly approached in their direction. Luna
          nods.

          “I guess it’s time for the big reveal,” he said, patting Luna’s head. “Welcome home, Luna.”

          I just told them last morning about what happened with the blackout. From malfunctioning to my pendant disappearing... and Lauena. Ona-san
          backed me up with what he’d seen, up to the point that he met her for the first time. Everyone was already excited to meet her, and I
          couldn’t be happier about it.
          <br><br>
          He nods, sitting on the ground. “Now I have to think about what to do for tomorrow’s monthly commemorative event.”
          <br><br>
          I sit beside him, leaning on his shoulder while gently holding his hand. “I’m sure Lauena is also excited about it too. After everything
          that’s happened over a few days, you still served your purpose. And that’s one of the reasons I liked you.”
          <br><br>
          “You think so?”
          <br><br>
          I nod, beaming at him. “I mean, I could speak for everyone here. Since your first step on the island, we’ve already felt the lingering
          spirit that’s covering us like a soft blanket. You did so many things during those past years and there’s still more to look forward to.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s true,” he said, kissing my forehead. “And that’s one of the reasons I want to stay for good. Aside from the amenities and everything
          so far, I’m looking forward to more years of lingering relationships with all of you.”
          <br><br>
          “Pyon.”
          <br><br>
          <b>POV: Koharu</b>
          <br><br>
          <i>The next morning...</i>
          <br><br>
          “Ona-sama,” I called up to the Owner upon seeing him at the bay. “Ohayou.”
          <br><br>
          “Ohayou,” he bows. “How are you?”
          <br><br>
          “I’m good, just had a peaceful sleep.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s good to know,” he returns his gaze to the ocean. “What do you think about the upcoming commemoration? Is it gonna be any good?”
          <br><br>
          “I’m sure it is,” I beam at him.
          <br><br>
          From the outskirts of the poolside, Fiona is tending to the tables with Elise and Helena while Nyotengu and the others chatter about. Misaki
          approaches our direction, as she just had a tray full of Jasmine tea.
          <br><br>
          “Arigatou,” I said, taking a teacup.
          <br><br>
          “Thanks,” he said, taking his. “Let’s take a sip together, shall we?”
          <br><br>
          <i>Minutes later...</i>
          <br><br>
          We’re almost done with our tea when Luna steps in to remind him, “Lauena’s ready.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s good,” he said, gazing at me. “Koharu, get the girls. We’re going for a little tour around the back.”
          <br><br>
          <b>POV: Owner</b>
          <br><br>
          When everyone has been gathered altogether, I begin my salutations. “So... this is it. Today is the beginning of the monthly commemoration for
          Lauena. She might be an alien under the public eye, she still remains just like you and me... a Venus whose responsibility is her new norm of
          living. She’s already tending to our mini power plant, but she’s ready to meet us all.”
          <br><br>
          “Now, let’s follow him as he makes his way around the back,” Luna instructed as I began the expedition. Everyone was amazed how I managed to
          put the solar panels in their respective places as I told them a little bit about my experience, especially in the last-minute. As we approach
          the back of the mansion, there’s a cheeky-looking door which leads to the main panel... in short, that room is both the power room and Lauena’s
          home.
          <br><br>
          Slowly, I knock on the door. “Lauena, we’re coming in.”
          <br><br>
          “Please do,” Lauena said, appearing ready from the other side.
          <br><br>
          I then slowly open the door, everyone watching as I enter to see Lauena in her human form. By appearance, Lauena is wearing a Yukata that’s
          closely similar to Koharu’s Kimono but with a palette similar to the Alien Heart. She sports a brown, long hair that’s tied to a braid
          similar to Helena’s. She’s 162cm tall; and has measurements of 79cm bust, 53cm waist, and 78cm hips. She looks like a 23 year-old, although
          unsure about her age at the moment. She appears a bit tanned, but she’s still boasting her pearl white skin.
          <br><br>
          Immediately, she approaches to embrace me, her arms around my waist. “Ona-sama! How are you?”
          <br><br>
          I smile, gazing at her face. “They’re here.”
          <br><br>
          She turns to face the girls of all ages and sizes, and was amazed at how they managed to get along with each other. “Wow...”
          <br><br>
          From the left, Luna slowly approaches our direction, patting Lauena’s head. “How are you, sweetie?”
          <br><br>
          “I’m good,” she beams at Luna. “It’s nice to finally see you in person.”
          <br><br>
          Luna gazes at the main panel where the pendant was currently perching on. “So she houses the whole panel, causing her to get out of her
          shell.”
          <br><br>
          “It seems so,” I said, looking at the pendant. As for Lauena, there’s a reason why she wanted to have the pendant be there in the first
          place: She wants to live here on this precious island.
          <br><br>
          I slowly get up, taking the camera out of my pocket as I place it on the wall, the lens facing the main panel. Then I get a free wire
          and connect it to the camera’s power outlet, so that it stays on.
          <br><br>
          “Oh, please come in,” Lauena said, the girls slowly fitting in to see the room. It’s rather a small room, but it has the necessities
          that make it act like a mini house.
          <br><br>
          “And it’s done,” I said, gazing at the panel. “We’ll hold the ceremony in the evening.”
          <br><br>
          While Lauena meets everyone one-by-one, Helena pulls me into a soft embrace with a smile on her face. “I’m so proud of you, sweetie.
          I really am.”
          <br><br>
          <i>That evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          Everyone’s gathering around the poolside as I get out of the mansion. “So I assume everyone is ready for what’s coming up next.”
          <br><br>
          They nod.
          <br><br>
          “Well then. In two minutes, we begin the commemoration of Lauena’s inception as the new Venus, currently working in the energy sector.
          I’ll be back in a bit.”
          <br><br>
          As I head out of the scene, the display lit up, displaying the video feed of the main panel while the pendant’s heart animates in colors
          of sky-blue and pink. In the distance, Lauena can be seen tending to her hair as she prepares for the event.
          <br><br>
          A minute left and I’m already inside Lauena’s room, facing the camera as my hands touch the lever. That’s the lever that relays the
          energy from the panel to the whole mansion, and beyond. “Lauena, I hope you’re ready for showtime.”
          <br><br>
          “I am,” said Lauena.
          <br><br>
          Thirty seconds left and the girls at the poolside began counting down. Five seconds left and we both countdown to zero. “Five,” I
          begin the count.
          <br><br>
          “Four.”
          <br><br>
          “Three...”
          <br><br>
          “Two...”
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          “... one.”
          <br><br>
          Immediately, I pull the lever down, putting the whole island on blackout. The pendant display powers off, and Lauena is nowhere to be
          seen. Taking the pendant out, I head out back to the poolside without some light guiding my way.
          <br><br>
          Back at the poolside, the girls have their smartphone’s flashlight on. I then place the pendant back to Luna’s Alien Heart (yes, she
          still wears it), and her body glows in white. Lauena is now out of the shell, expressing her salutations as the girls and I commemorate
          this wholesome feat.
          <br><br>
          <i>The next morning...</i>
          <br><br>
          I’m back at the Suite, about to finish writing my experiences so far as the next journal entry when I heard a soft knock on the door.
          “May I come in?”
          <br><br>
          “Oh sure,” I said, hearing the door creak open. When I turn to gaze at the girl, my mind instantly flashes back to that one scenery she
          will not forget: The night of our first kiss under the glistening moonlight as the whole island is succumbed by a blackout.
          <br><br>
          “Lauena...”
          <br><br>
          I slowly approach her direction, pulling her into a soft embrace. At the journal, it reads the following:
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> The Venus Island is full of surprises and mysteries that no one would expect. And
            as someone who dares to unravel those mysteries, I already found myself in a position where I have to protect in order to keep on going.
            And today, I’m writing this to tell you that I did it.
            <br><br>
            Lauena... she’s that one kind of girl whose duty is kept a secret from the public. She’s still an alien, but to me, she’s already a friend
            whom I can rely on when the time comes. And someday, we might get to know each other better. A few days since I met her and I can already
            feel her wonder of longing.
            <br><br>
            As for Luna, she’ll be the one whom I’ll put my heart to this week. I know things have been very hard for her, and I won’t back out the
            moment she’s in peril. The same goes for the others.
            <br><br>
            Hopefully, with this feat, people will soon realize the value of relationships as our bondage with each other is in full bloom.
