        <em>Published 30 January 2021</em>
        <p>
          The first of Helena’s Inside Story series, focusing on her ample revival of romantic interest as her now-Beloved
          Owner/Husband takes care of everything else. Let’s begin at how his sixth month on the island became the start of
          her bloom towards love.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>POV: Helena</b>
          <br><br>
          As I look up at the morning sky on a Saturday, I begin to reflect on what has been more than eight years since his
          first stay on the island. I somehow ponder on what accomplishments we’ve done for each other and the rest of the
          girls as time goes on.
          <br><br>
          Holding a cup of Jasmine tea, my true sweetheart--the Owner--stands beside me as we turn our gaze on a nearby
          island. “It’s been a long time since you came here,” I said.
          <br><br>
          “Yeah,” he chuckles. “Just how much has changed over the course of eight years...”
          <br><br>
          I nod, holding his hand.
          <br><br>
          As the morning continued, we set out across the café back to our renovated mansion, full of individual rooms and
          amenities fit for girls of all ages and sizes. “This is still like the one we used to,” I quote, making him chuckle
          for a bit.
          <br><br>
          Across the garden were some red and white Roses, as well as the Hibiscuses and hanging Wisterias, among their
          neighboring flowering plants. “It must be really nostalgic that there used to be none when I got here,” he said.
          “Times sure have changed.”
          <br><br>
          Proceeding inside reveals Marie Rose and Honoka, who were waiting for our arrival. They’re in their respective maid
          outfits. “Good morning, Ona-san! Good morning, Madame Helena!”
          <br><br>
          We both nod, proceeding to the Master Bedroom--which used to be the Suite. Handing over the biography book from him,
          I begin to flip the pages.
          <br><br>
          “The first photo we took together... was when you’re just 6 months into the island,” I quote, flipping the pages
          backwards. “It was that short of a gap because of my feelings back then.”
          <br><br>
          He chuckles with delight. “Yeah, I can remember back then...”
          <br><br>
          <i>Several years ago...</i>
          <br><br>
          This morning marks the Owner’s sixth month at the Venus Island, and things weren’t as dire as I thought. Nagisa seemed
          to be cooled off for the meantime, while her little sister Misaki takes care of her. The others seem to be enjoying
          themselves as much as Marie does.
          <br><br>
          From the aisle, I can see him gazing at the pier while taking a photo. I look at the camera to see what he’s taking a
          picture of.
          <br><br>
          “Is something the matter?” I ask, inching closer to him.
          <br><br>
          “Oh?” He locks his gaze at me. “I just thought of taking some photos while I’m here. Honoka really wanted me to take some
          pictures for her grandma back home, so I had to take this opportunity to capture some of the areas as well. I just think
          they look cool behind the lens.”
          <br><br>
          “Wow.”
          <br><br>
          “What’s more, I think I need these if I have to carry around the memories written in here,” he added, taking another shot.
          <br><br>
          “But you had some adjustments in-between...”
          <br><br>
          “Let me tell you: I’m somehow good at photography. I even took the course for this,” he smiles. “I just need to get used to
          it just in case an opportunity arrives.”
          <br><br>
          I couldn’t be happier than seeing him taking his time with the camera. It feels that in each passing moment, he always keeps
          his head up as he takes another shot. And another. And my heart pounces with each shutter, waiting for a spark to surface
          around my chest.
          <br><br>
          As soon as he finishes on that spot, he turns to me, already flushed. “Is something the matter?” He asks with a beam on his
          face.
          <br><br>
          “No no no, I’m good.”
          <br><br>
          “Well then, can you please keep me company for today? I need your assistance for my next batch,” he suggested, carrying the
          camera and the tripod. I just nod as I follow him to wherever he goes.
          <br><br>
          <i>That evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          As soon as everyone finished eating, I went out again to see what he’s doing. “It’s the same as usual,” I thought.
          <br><br>
          But I didn’t get the point. What I saw outside were flowers of different types and sizes decorated around the mini pavilion.
          Misaki arrived in her 2nd Anniversary Outfit, patting my back. “Hey, Helen.”
          <br><br>
          “Hey,” I said. “What’s going on here?”
          <br><br>
          “Oh... Ona wants to give us all a monthly pictorial starting today, so he prepared everything by himself,” she said. “Why
          aren’t you dressed up yet?”
          <br><br>
          “What? I somehow didn’t get it...”
          <br><br>
          “Like I said before, we’ll be doing the monthly pictorials starting tonight. So you better be prepared if you want to get
          his attention!”
          <br><br>
          “Oh okay, but I don’t know what I should wear...”
          <br><br>
          “For this month, it has to be elegant and pretty! I heard that you’re one of the pioneers here on this island that has beauty
          beyond expectations...”
          <br><br>
          “B- But...” I stutter as I’m lost for words.
          <br><br>
          “Come on! I’m pretty sure he’ll like you~”
          <br><br>
          I’m literally flushed by that remark. Did she just want to make me be sweet around him?
          <br><br>
          Just in time for the others to get out, in their elegant outfits. Tina is in her Champs Elysees--the main apparel for the
          Venuses, Sayuri is in her Diao Chan Outfit, and Lobelia in her Fierte Midi. “Helena-sama, why aren’t you dressed up yet?”
          Lobelia asks in a calm tone.
          <br><br>
          “Oh, I don’t know anything elegant to wear... I don’t have that much stuff aligned with that category in my closet. If there
          was, then it might have been way appealing... but it doesn’t.”
          <br><br>
          “Aw come on,” Tamaki sterned at me, wearing her 1st Anniversary Outfit. “It has to be anything close to that!”
          <br><br>
          “Hey, would you girls mind if I’ll be back in a bit?” He steps forward, holding my hand. “She’ll be wearing something
          special for tonight.”
          <br><br>
          I just remained in shock. “What... ?”
          <br><br>
          “Don’t worry about it. This one’ll be one of your favorites,” he winks. “It’s a good one, I promise.”
          <br><br>
          Together, we set off to the Tailor’s Room where he pulls out a gown of sorts that somehow looks elegant to me. “It’s an
          elegant gown, and I made it myself.”
          <br><br>
          “You... yourself?!” I shriek. “H- How on earth did you do that?”
          <br><br>
          “A little bit of dedication, perhaps. Now go ahead and wear it.”
          <br><br>
          A few minutes later, I already found myself entranced by its beauty. By appearance, it’s filled with truffles on the sides,
          with a long skirt stretching to a few meters long. Yellow and white gems are placed at the chest region, with gold adornments
          in some areas. It has a veil which stretches the same length as the overall length of this outfit. And the colors? They match
          with my hair color--Blond.
          <br><br>
          As I glance in awe, I begin to wonder if this is his first time doing this type of outfit. Not a swimsuit that one can wear
          during the Festivals, but rather a derivation of the evening gown. “Is this your first time doing this?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          He nods slowly. “Yep, and to the point that it’s something that good.”
          <br><br>
          “It looks good... I wonder what the others will have to say when I show it off...”
          <br><br>
          Going back outside, the girls are already glancing at my outfit as I close in. “You look so elegant,” says Ayane. “Looking good
          as always,” quotes Koharu.
          <br><br>
          “As expected from my Master,” Marie reacted, a smile wearing on her face.
          <br><br>
          “Now I can see why Marie depends on you sometimes,” he chuckles, looking at me. “Don’t worry, I can live with that.”
          <br><br>
          I just sigh, giving Marie headpats to make up for that. And Kokoro, too.
          <br><br>
          And thus tonight begins the monthly photoshoot. Starting off with Misaki, whose revealing her skin leaves something to be desired.
          Alongside that, Nagisa tried to show off hers, too.
          <br><br>
          I waited patiently as the girls took their own time. I’m the last to take a picture, so I tried to concentrate.
          <br><br>
          <i>Minutes later...</i>
          <br><br>
          “Helen?” He approaches as I’m about to stand up. It’s my turn now. “Show them what you got.”
          <br><br>
          I take a deep breath, going up the podium as I prepare myself for the photoshoot. As everyone watches from their respective seats,
          I briefly glance at the Owner who’s preparing the camera.
          <br><br>
          “I wonder what adjustments are applied for my shoot,” I thought to myself.
          <br><br>
          “And it’s done,” he said, pointing the lights to my direction. “Helen, please prepare your pose.”
          <br><br>
          “Okay. Here goes...”
          <br><br>
          And without a hitch, I did the VV Pose firsthand. And then came the shutter, all lights flashing at me from different angles at the
          same time.
          <br><br>
          “It looks like you could re-run our photo studio sometime,” Elise reprimanded. “Those were top-notch.”
          <br><br>
          He chuckles upon that response, signaling me to do another pose.
          <br><br>
          My own Island Visit Pose was one of my favorites because it signifies my divine beauty whilst being entranced by the amenities. As
          soon as I did that pose, another click of the shutter took place.
          <br><br>
          “Alright, please come down for a bit,” he said, instructing me to get down the podium.
          <br><br>
          “Yes?”
          <br><br>
          “I need you to hold this prop,” he said, handing me a bouquet. “And one last thing...”
          <br><br>
          He proceeds to go behind me, preparing the veil that was tied to my hair the whole time. By the time he’s done, I looked like a
          Bride-to-Be... or a Bride myself.
          <br><br>
          “Wh- Why are you doing this?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          “I just thought that you need to be more special since this is your first photoshoot and all,” he said, his face slowly blushing.
          <br><br>
          “What... why are you blushing?” I ask, trying to recollect his thoughts.
          <br><br>
          He can’t help but blush a bit more. “I’m just... yeah, seeing you happy makes me happy, at least.”
          <br><br>
          I can’t help but blush as well, seeing that I’m closely attached to him in some aspects without knowing about it. “... I think
          you’re right.”
          <br><br>
          “Alright, now please go back to the podium,” he said, going back to his position. I did as told.
          <br><br>
          He gazes at me one more time before he prepares the camera. “Are you ready?” He asks. I nod.
          <br><br>
          “Okay. Next pose, please.”
          <br><br>
          As I prepare myself to do one pose that might surprise him, he prepares his camera. I was about to close my eyes to mesmerize the
          memory when...
          <br><br>
          He clicks the shutter, but nothing happens. “What... ?” I thought.
          <br><br>
          Stepping down from his position, he turns around. “Misaki, I’ll be out for a few minutes as I change clothes. The timer is set to
          5 minutes. Please monitor the camera while I’m not here, okay?”
          <br><br>
          “What?!” I shriek.
          <br><br>
          “You girls keep on the lookout for Helen, alright? I’ll be back ASAP.”
          <br><br>
          “Wait, where are you going?” I cried. But it’s too late as he speeds into the mansion. Fiona can only hold me as she musters,
          “Don’t worry, he’ll be back here quickly.”
          <br><br>
          “B- But...”
          <br><br>
          <i>A whole minute left...</i>
          <br><br>
          It’s been four minutes and there’s still no sign of him. Could he already be disappearing? Maybe I’m just quick to assume because
          it wasn’t a long time before so, but still!
          <br><br>
          Just as I was about to take a step forward out of the podium, he reappeared, albeit being in a different... outfit. “What’s that
          you’re wearing?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          “Oh, this?” He wanders about before facing my direction. “Nothing too formal or anything, but a little something to match up with
          yours, I guess.”
          <br><br>
          By appearance, his top has the same truffles as mine, with the sleeves featuring the outlines of my hair band. On the edge features
          the calligraphic designs, and--
          <br><br>
          “Now’s not the time for details. We’re almost thirty seconds out,” he interrupted my thoughts, proceeding to the podium.
          <br><br>
          “Oh right,” I said, following suit as we prepared our pose.
          <br><br>
          “Twenty-five seconds,” Misaki looks at the timer. “Is everything ready?”
          <br><br>
          “Yep.”
          <br><br>
          And then we waited for a few seconds, our pose in place. Then comes the shutter, and the lights. What revealed in the photo were two
          people wearing their respective outfits bearing similar truffles and colors. To be honest, we almost look like newlyweds--except that
          we’re not right now... at least that’s what I thought for now.
          <br><br>
          The girls clapped and cheered as we got off the podium. “You definitely look good,” I said, beaming at him as he does so.
          <br><br>
          Patting my head, he replied, “Heh. Me too.”
          <br><br>
          <i>The next morning...</i>
          <br><br>
          I’m busy sorting the physical copies out as the girls sort out the frame. I walked around the block to find him still printing the
          photos from last night.
          <br><br>
          Preparing him some coffee, I stumble around Marie Rose and Honoka fiddling around with pencils. “Seems they’re doing art together,”
          I thought.
          <br><br>
          Upon returning to the room where he’s printing, a lot of photos were laid out on the clean floor. He begins to notice the coffee I
          made for him. “Here, it’s for you.”
          <br><br>
          “Thanks,” he said, receiving the blend. “That smells delicious.”
          <br><br>
          “Likewise. Seems you’re not done yet.”
          <br><br>
          “Don’t worry, I’m almost done. Have you got any plans this week?”
          <br><br>
          I then ponder upon that. “We don’t have new agenda for the entire week, so I think we might have to--”
          <br><br>
          “Hey, there will be no Festivals this week as we take a little unwinding,” he said, beaming at me.
          <br><br>
          Is he serious about this?
          <br><br>
          “To make up for that temporary loss, can I take you somewhere you’ll like?” He continues. “Maybe a little bit of Casino to boot?”
          <br><br>
          “I... I don’t know if I could make up for that, but...”
          <br><br>
          “Hey, are you done with printing?” Misaki barges in, carrying the tools. “We’ll take care of the rest.”
          <br><br>
          “Oh, just in time,” he said, looking at the last paper being feeded in. “I’m printing the last one, then you’ll take care of it. Is the
          special frame ready to go?”
          <br><br>
          “As obliged,” Nagisa comes in, a special frame in hand.
          <br><br>
          “That’s big...” I thought upon looking at the frame.
          <br><br>
          It took a whole minute for the print to finish. “Where did you get the printer, anyway?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          “I just found it lying around the storage room without any use whatsoever,” he said. “It took me hours to get it working.”
          <br><br>
          “You sure are fond of electronics, I’m wondering,” Misaki glances at the printer.
          <br><br>
          He then takes the final printed paper out to the table, bringing out his pen as he writes about on the bottom-right of it. As soon as
          he’s done, he points the pen to me. “Please have your signature on it.”
          <br><br>
          “M- Me?” I shriek, trying to glance at the printed copy. It’s indeed the first photo we took together at the podium!
          <br><br>
          Before I can sign the photo, my heart trembles. Am I really putting my heart to him that much?!
          <br><br>
          “I’ll make it up for you, don’t worry about it,” he winks.
          <br><br>
          After signing the print, we’re set off to the pier just across the beach, treating me to some Blancmanges. Wait, how did he do it that
          quick?
          <br><br>
          “May I ask you something?” I ask. He nods, lending me his ear.
          <br><br>
          “How come you made my specialty that quick? It merely took years for the previous Owner to do it himself, as far as I can remember,” I
          said, gazing at the delicacy. “Did you take your research into it?”
          <br><br>
          “You bet it is,” he chuckled, eating the Blancmange. “I’ve practiced a lot before I came here. Remember the other day when I made
          Nyotengu her own Manjū?”
          <br><br>
          Wow... I can’t even believe that he also used to treat others with their delicacies that he made with his own hands in a short time. I
          suddenly feel inspired upon knowing that.
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, I do,” I said, sipping my coffee. “It was so good that I can’t seem to want more of it as much as she does.”
          <br><br>
          We talked for hours while glancing at the ocean and the neighboring islands, all while the girls are busy with their stuff. Nyotengu
          approaches us from behind, wanting to taste his Blancmanges, too.
          <br><br>
          “Oh... they taste good, Ona-dono,” she exclaims, her eyes gleaming in delight.
          <br><br>
          He beams at her in complete satisfaction. “Glad you like them.”
          <br><br>
          “By the way, Ona-dono,” she sits beside him on his left. “Have you got any plans for tonight? I probably might need your help...”
          <br><br>
          “Oh sure,” he said. “Just tell me what it is.”
          <br><br>
          “Alright... I need help fixing my Kimono for a special commemorative treat,” Nyotengu expresses her intention. I glance at them in shock.
          <br><br>
          “A Kimono?!” I shriek. “B- But what for?”
          <br><br>
          “I see,” he said, tending to another Blancmange. “Did Elise tell you about it?”
          <br><br>
          Nyotengu’s eyes lit up. “Elise?”
          <br><br>
          “Yep. She’s our planner,” he giggles about. “When I first learned about it, I thought she’s just having her time with things. But as
          days go by, she seems to be having fun with it, too. Just last Monday, she asked me if there’s gonna be another Event Festival to boot.”
          <br><br>
          Nyotengu and Helena’s eyes lit up in awe. “Wow...”
          <br><br>
          “Anyways, sure! I’ll be needing your Kimono shortly,” he said, Nyo nodding in agreement before leaving the scenery.
          <br><br>
          Then we spent the next few hours lounging around the island as I toured him to other amenities. At one time at the Nikki Beach...
          <br><br>
          “I don’t know if I told you this once in the letters, but I almost had a relationship once,” I told him. Do you remember Zack?”
          <br><br>
          “Zack? You mean the guy who once used to own one of the islands in this colony? He’s a former DJ-turned-fighter, right?”
          <br><br>
          “Yes... before this island existed, I stayed on this island called the New Zack Island. I’m not quite sure why, but a part of it is that it
          has most of the amenities the same as on here.”
          <br><br>
          He nods briefly. “I see.”
          <br><br>
          “One time, I became somewhat interested in him upon knowing that he ran the island on his own accord. It even got to the point that he
          took his gamble to try and court me. But, as the Head of DOATEC, I need to set my standards, so I declined and told him to treat me as a
          friend... even when I’m already considered a Venus in his island beforehand.”
          <br><br>
          “What started out as a love interest, now leads to courtship? Why’d you turn that down?” He asked.
          <br><br>
          “I think he’s not that good of a husband material, I’m being told. There are some times that he acted like a jerk, like others do.”
          <br><br>
          “What comes natural to them is just natural. They can learn from it and improve, especially when we’re talking about relationships with
          opposite genders,” he said. “I almost got to that route, but thanks to the advice from the girls that I helped before, that gave me the
          courage to be responsible.”
          <br><br>
          Upon understanding that sentence, I looked down on the ground. “It wouldn’t hurt that much, right?”
          <br><br>
          “I guess so, considering I’ve been in failed relationships before. I know I haven’t told you and everyone else about this, but...”
          <br><br>
          “I know,” I said. “In fact, I probably should tell you something I haven’t told everyone else.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah?”
          <br><br>
          “I... I almost got raped.”
          <br><br>
          “...”
          <br><br>
          His gaze turned into a heap of concern after I admitted that.
          <br><br>
          “I... I don’t know what to say.”
          <br><br>
          “After the fall of DOATEC, Marie and I were struggling to leave the incident when a group of monsters cornered us in an alley. With the
          nefarious things on their shoulders, all we’re left to do is to accept defeat. They... they ruined our clothes. They touched us from head
          to toe. And for one second that we tried to retaliate, they left us with no mercy. They started screwing us, making us suck their dirty
          balls.” I begin crying as I struggle to continue. “No one’s there to help us... we’re hopeless. We’re doomed to see them impregnate us over
          and over again until we’re nothing but pregnant women.”
          <br><br>
          <i>Flashback...</i>
          <br><br>
          A group of monsters--orcs--are scattered around the alley as Marie and I scream around, naked and hopeless.
          <br><br>
          “Please, don’t do this to us,” I beg them.
          <br><br>
          But they refused. One of the monsters took advantage and slapped me multiple times in the face, until I’m unconscious. Trying to defend
          me, Marie had the same fate.
          <br><br>
          As the climax draws closer, I can already feel myself loosening from the grasp as I succumb to pregnancy. They keep screwing us over and
          over, feeling like they need to release their lust into our bodies.
          <br><br>
          “Please... help...”
          <br><br>
          Then, just as I was about to receive their pre-marital fruit as a sign of defeat, I saw a faint light hovering above me as the mysterious
          person fends off the monsters with force. I could only glance in defeat as he fights them off in a hand-to-hand combat. I wonder if it’s
          already too late to need any help...
          <br><br>
          “Hey, are you okay?” The mysterious person asked, tending to my figure. “You look hurt.”
          <br><br>
          “It’s... okay... Marie needs help, too...”
          <br><br>
          They nod, tending to Marie next as I lay myself with my head to the left. What have I been doing for the past hour? I’m just worthless
          without my title as the Head of DOATEC.
          <br><br>
          “Hold on, I’ll be right back,” they said, leaving the scenery. What are they trying to do, leaving us naked like this?
          <br><br>
          Literally a few seconds have passed, and they came back with a bunch of tools and clothes. “Alright, I might need to inspect your insides
          for a bit to make sure there’s no fertilization going on. Is that okay with you?”
          <br><br>
          “Wait... are you... going to be alright with this?” I asked.
          <br><br>
          “Don’t worry about it, I’ve been trained to do this.”
          <br><br>
          Starting with myself, they examined my insides as I closed my eyes. I know he’s well-trained, but how would he do that?
          <br><br>
          Shortly, they inspected Marie’s, too. “You both haven’t received anything close to pregnancy, but because of the intercourse that they put
          against you, they need to be cleaned as soon as possible.”
          <br><br>
          They prepare a hose, connected to the water faucet, then aims below my stomach. “Don’t worry, this’ll take a while.”
          <br><br>
          Then they proceed to wash the impurities away from our body, handing us a towel to keep us dry. “I’ve prepared some clothes for you, but
          with all the trauma that you can get, I’ll take you to the nearest clinic.”
          <br><br>
          After we got dressed, Marie launched ahead to hug them. “Thank you... for saving us.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, we greatly appreciate it. If you weren’t there we would have been impregnated by now. Can you please tell us your name?”
          <br><br>
          The mysterious person responded, introducing himself. “My name is Mike. Nice to meet you two.”
          <br><br>
          After a few minutes, he sent us off to the nearest clinic for admission. Before he could leave, he gave me a card. “I found a contact that
          might admit you in your new home. Though he might seem a little perverted, we couldn’t agree more that he wants to take care of all of you.”
          <br><br>
          “Thanks... hopefully I can return the favor if our eyes meet again, Mike.”
          <br><br>
          “Likewise. You too, Marie.”
          <br><br>
          Marie smiles happily as he leaves the clinic, leaving us with the card.
          <br><br>
          <i>End of flashback...</i>
          <br><br>
          “... and that was the moment I met with the previous Owner, years after leaving the Zack Island and just after the incident.”
          <br><br>
          He glances in awe. “That’s a hard life you have to go through.”
          <br><br>
          “It was. But all of that still remains a secret since we’re with other Venuses around these parts. So you may still see me as the Head of
          DOATEC up to today,” I sighed. “I just don’t want them to know about that bad past I had...”
          <br><br>
          He takes his courage and pats my back. “I understand... maybe we can have a discussion with everyone else if time permits, assuming they have
          the same perspective as yours.”
          <br><br>
          I smiled a bit. “But you know, despite everything, I won’t even forget the same day someone helped me and Marie when we almost reached the
          peril’s edge. Without him, we wouldn’t be here by now,” I said, caressing my stomach. “I would’ve given up my dignity and became like a slut
          to the monsters.”
          <br><br>
          “Can you at least tell me his name?” He asked.
          <br><br>
          “Mike,” I replied. “His name is Mike. I don’t know his last name, though.”
          <br><br>
          “I see,” he sighs, looking at the morning sky. “He must’ve heard your plea and did whatever he could to keep you out of trouble.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, even if it’s just once,” I giggle. “In fact, I already made the decision to repay him just in case we meet again... even if it means
          giving up my role for his sake.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, I’m pretty sure you’re going to great lengths just for that one favor. But in the end, everything will be worth it.”
          <br><br>
          “True,” I lay myself down on the ground, my back against the sand. “I wonder how he’s doing right now...”
          <br><br>
          “He might be living a life for himself, saving people because he has to,” he follows suit.
          <br><br>
          Then we spent the whole noon doing nothing other than gazing at the blue sky. We just decided to take some time off because of what just
          happened in the last six months. It might be pretty hectic, I know, but he handled it pretty well. I wonder if I could repay that favor
          someday?
          <br><br>
          “What if,” he musters. “One day, the one who saved you from that peril, became the owner of the prestigious island around the coast, and
          you happen to be the inhabitants of it?”
          <br><br>
          I gaze at him in surprise. “What?”
          <br><br>
          He gazes at me in utter curiosity. “What will you do?”
          <br><br>
          “I, uh...”
          <br><br>
          To be honest, I haven’t felt the same romantic desire as I intended to happen during that time. What should I do if that happens to be
          the case?
          <br><br>
          “It’s up to you to decide. After all, you just need to return the favor, right?”
          <br><br>
          “Well, yeah...”
          <br><br>
          The next few days were us hanging out with each other as well as the others. Everything went well that time, up to the point that I
          somehow got too close to him during that period. His soft touch on my cheeks felt like heaven, I can’t even remember if it’s that same
          feeling I had back at the peril’s edge.
          <br><br>
          Upon reading his biography that he submitted just months before his arrival, he used to take care of people, especially girls. That’s
          why he’s much admired by them and wanted to follow in his footsteps. But then, one reveal took everything to a toll. Kokoro told me that
          she used to meet him once just to find us.
          <br><br>
          “I can vaguely remember back then that he used to meet me down the street while I was looking for both of you,” quoted Kokoro. “He then
          told me the exact location you were at, at the clinic a few blocks from where I stood.”
          <br><br>
          “Did he tell you his name?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          “Unfortunately, no... but then after the incident I began investigating his identity. And it continued even here, that I have to know if
          he looked like the same guy who asked me where you are.”
          <br><br>
          It just so happened that we were a few feet away from the sleeping Owner. What if he overheard our conversation? I turn my head just to
          make sure he doesn’t notice.
          <br><br>
          “This may not be true, but what if...”
          <br><br>
          “What if?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          Kokoro raises her eyebrow. “What if he’s the one I bumped into back then? Could it be a coincidence that he wants to return the favor?”
          <br><br>
          “I’m not gonna get in the way of assuming things for now, so we’ll leave it at that. We’ll need more information about his identity while
          we’re at it, too.”
          <br><br>
          Kokoro nods at the sentiment.
          <br><br>
          <i>Few weeks later...</i>
          <br><br>
          “Is something the matter?” He asks, wondering what I’m doing as of late.
          <br><br>
          I stopped writing something on a piece of paper. “Oh, it’s nothing... I was just trying to reciprocate my thoughts on what happened during
          those past weeks, is all.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah,” he sighs, sitting on the bed. “Next month is Luna’s birthday, so how should we celebrate?”
          <br><br>
          “Wait, really? Time flies so fast...”
          <br><br>
          “So I have to suggest that we need to prepare early just in case that arrives.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah,” I nod. “We don’t want her to be disappointed considering that she stayed here for years like we did.”
          <br><br>
          “Uh-huh.”
          <br><br>
          We set out to plan Luna’s birthday together, taking turns on the tasks given to us. Some of the girls have assisted in our efforts, even
          Luna herself, too, helped out.
          <br><br>
          Then came her birthday exactly a month later, 15 October. It’s pretty much different from the previous birthdays held over the past years
          during the previous Owner’s time, that the girls started to notice something different. But instead of something bad, it’s something
          serene and elegant.
          <br><br>
          “I’m glad that the efforts already paid off in the end,” I exclaimed, handing a piece of cake to him. “Everything sure has changed in a
          short while since you got here.”
          <br><br>
          He giggles. “Don’t worry about it. If, by any chance, anyone can suggest we do this all day, then we’ll do that.”
          <br><br>
          “B- But aren’t you afraid of the budget?” Kanna asked. “I mean, during his time, we’re always that low due to events and
          suggestions-turned-reality scenarios.”
          <br><br>
          “Figured that would happen, I actually haven’t spent a single Zack Dollar on everything,” he giggles.
          <br><br>
          “Oh wait, who’s our auditor?” I asked. Elise raises her hand.
          <br><br>
          Oh wait a second...
          <br><br>
          Anyways, I then continue the question, “And how much Zack Dollars do we have right now?”
          <br><br>
          “I hate to tell you but it’s pretty big,” Elise answered the query. “About I believe 28 million from the last time I wrote.”
          <br><br>
          “Twenty-eight million?!” The girls begin to shriek.
          <br><br>
          “And what’s even more interesting is that NONE of these were invested since his arrival,” she continues. “Even the upgrades to our
          swimsuits were of his own budget, he admitted the other day.”
          <br><br>
          “Hey, I know I’m not that rich, but I always keep the majority of the funds for a rainy day,” he said, sipping on his wine. “I’m not
          really in the mood for materialism.”
          <br><br>
          “But you did this for us! You can just invest in anything using Zack Dollars without us complaining about it,” Misaki holds his arm.
          <br><br>
          “I have something planned that’ll put them to good use, don’t you worry,” he responds, giving her headpats. “Something useful for years
          to come.”
          <br><br>
          “Ona-san...” I somehow managed to lean my head on his shoulder. “Were you always like this? Just helping everyone without hesitation and
          even knowing about them?”
          <br><br>
          “I’ll tell you what,” he said, caressing my head. “I’ve been like this for years. Helping others is my expertise and I will help them in
          any way I can, no matter what happens and what their true colors are. Showing your good deed to people will prove your righteousness to
          the nation, they said.”
          <br><br>
          “So that’s why you’re keen on really trying your best to help almost anybody,” Nagisa sipped her coffee. “I truly admire you, really.”
          <br><br>
          “It’s nothing to be admired about. My goal is to reconnect everyone and get back to the old ways of bonding, where people of different
          aspects interact with each other... as people.”
          <br><br>
          As he continues to give us lessons and opening up on his experiences, I could only feel sadness in my heart. I feel sad for him, really.
          I’m just wishing that whatever his next route will be, here’s hoping he can get to help us all at once.
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          For the sake of the Venus Island.
          <br><br>
          <i>Present day...</i>
          <br><br>
          “I just can’t believe that it’ll be the start of my long-yearned infatuation with you after everything you did,” I said, holding his hand.
          <br><br>
          “I know,” he giggles, fiddling with my wedding ring. We’re married, you see. “But would that mean you’re already infatuated with me since
          my first stay here?”
          <br><br>
          “Actually, just prior to your arrival... yes,” I smile. “I’m just that grateful that the one who’s the new Owner was actually someone who
          helped me during my peril... and I just can’t wait to return the favor. I’m just... I’m a little bit empty at first, you know.”
          <br><br>
          “Ah,” he realized. “Could you at least tell me what happened during that period?”
