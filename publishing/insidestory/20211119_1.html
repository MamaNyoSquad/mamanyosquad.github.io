        <h3>Nyotengu’s Inside Story</h3>
        <em>Published 19 November 2021</em>
        <p>
          As Nyotengu’s birthday is just around the corner, the stage is set for the new Owner to help out the three Admirers for the sake
          of the Venus Island.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>POV: Nyotengu</b>
          <br><br>
          As I glance over the sunset, I begin to wonder what I’ll be doing for my birthday. Tomorrow’s the start of my special week, so I
          assume the girls are ready to get prepared.
          <br><br>
          Slumping myself on the ground, I almost went for a swim as Fiona approached me from the right. “Nyo? Can I have you for a minute?”
          <br><br>
          Turning to gaze at her direction, I nod. “Sure.”
          <br><br>
          At the café, Monica, Misaki and Kanna are waiting at their seats. “Tomorrow’s your special week, how would you want it to be?”
          Misaki asked.
          <br><br>
          As Fiona and I take our seat, I begin to think deeply about it. “Since everyone considers me as the sexiest of them all, I guess we
          could have the theme to be just sexiness. You know how that works in my favor.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s not the point,” Monica contradicts, trying to aid in Misaki’s clarification. “What she’s trying to say is how we want your
          birthday to be in terms of its memorableness and novelty.”
          <br><br>
          “Fine,” I submit, going back to deeply thinking about it. “I guess if we have to take Ona-dono into consideration...”
          <br><br>
          “I’m sure he’ll remember every event as the memorable one,” Fiona said. “Look at how he’s trying his best to make me remember the
          best memories I had... up to the point with Tsukushi, however.”
          <br><br>
          “Speaking of Tsukushi,” I interrupt, letting my wings disappear in a white glow. “How is she?”
          <br><br>
          “Well, Ona has been taking care of her for the past few years, so I guess she felt better, at least.” Misaki hypothesizes as she
          hadn’t been instructed to inspect the Suite yet due to respecting their privacy.
          <br><br>
          “I guess we’ll just wait for them,” Kanna fidgets her hands. “That always works.”
          <br><br>
          “Perhaps,” Fiona reiterates. “I guess we should plan ahead of schedule to avoid any last-minute delays.”
          <br><br>
          “Absolutely,” I said, not knowing that his sweetie Helen is already approaching our direction. As soon as she does, she gently pats
          my head.
          <br><br>
          “Main?” Helena asks.
          <br><br>
          “S- sub?” I shriek, turning my back.
          <br><br>
          “What... how did that happen?” Monica stands in shock. I gotta admit, she rarely heard those before... those were some weird nicknames
          that our previous Owner used to call us. We got Miumiyu for Marie, Kaka for Kanna, heck! Even Monica got her own nickname: Monii.
          <br><br>
          Fiona has some interesting nicknames: Initially Fio, she has Hime-sama as it implies that she’s a Princess. Like, literally.
          <br><br>
          Misaki is no stranger to nicknames, especially when it comes to outfits she wears. I can still remember the Atelier Ryza × DOAXVV
          Collaboration where she wears Ryza’s outfit, therefore earning her nickname as Resident Ryza to just Reisalin--a nod to the main
          character Reisalin Stout.
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          Wait, why are we discussing nicknames? Oh that’s right, I’m the Main, Helen’s the Sub! We’re basically Main and Sub! I don’t know why
          that’s relevant...
          <br><br>
          “Pardon the interruption, but Elise and Sayuri want to see you,” Helen said in a straightforward manner. “I think that relates to your
          upcoming birthday party.”
          <br><br>
          “Sure, I’ll be with you in a hot minute.”
          <br><br>
          Turning to face the girls, I notify, “Alright, I should head out as Elise and Big Sis will be expecting my presence in a short minute.
          I’ll come back later so that we’ll discuss further details.”
          <br><br>
          “See you!” Misaki waved her hand goodbye, smiling as she looked at Fiona. Kanna beams at me as I leave the scene with Helen. Monica is
          still confused about what happened.
          <br><br>
          As we head straight inside the mansion, Lobelia approaches us from behind. I can only assume she is also invited for the meeting. Hitomi
          and Kokoro follow suit, only to change direction as they race up the stairs. As we head inside the Auditorium (seriously, this was among
          the other rooms planned to be added during the renovation period where Ona-dono was still recovering and Helen wasn’t with us), Elise and
          Sayuri can be seen in their casual outfits, complete with a tiara on their head.
          <br><br>
          “Mama Nyo,” Sayuri greeted with a smile on her face. “Tomorrow’s your special week~”
          <br><br>
          “I know,” I chuckle. “I need to be prepared for what’s about to happen next, though. What’s our agenda?”
          <br><br>
          “We already had the plans ahead of preparations. Now we’ll just need his approval to get started,” said Elise, handing the folder to my
          direction. Inside were a lot of write-ups and graphics that she made by hand. “Sayuri helped me with the event planning and where to put
          the decorations.”
          <br><br>
          “Isn’t that a bit too much? I mean, we usually didn’t cram the whole island with decorations,” I ask with a look of concern on my face as
          I scan through the folder containing some paperwork.
          <br><br>
          Helena pats my shoulder. “I mean, that would be possible; but, as Elise just said, we need his thoughts and approval first before we begin.”
          <br><br>
          “You’re right,” I said, closing the folder and handing it back to Elise. “At least we need to get the tables and chairs ready.”
          <br><br>
          “Good idea,” Sayuri nods. “I’ll get started with them right away.”
          <br><br>
          <b>POV: Nagisa</b>
          <br><br>
          <i>That evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          While I wait for Ona-san to arrive here at the café, I begin to hum the <a href="javascript:play()"><span style="color: #4f325c;"><b>song</b></span></a>
          I usually jam to. Somehow, I begin to dance gracefully, spinning around. I didn’t realize after a few spins that I started to get dizzy.
          <audio id="playAudio" src="../../media/audio/20211119_1-1.mp3" width="0" height="0"></audio>
          <script type="text/javascript">
            function play() {
              document.getElementById("playAudio").play();
            }
          </script>
          <br><br>
          I almost got toppled over when Ona-san caught me in time. “Woah!”
          <br><br>
          “Are you alright?” He asks, helping me stand from the fall. He’s still with Tsukushi at this point, but I don’t have the guts to complain.
          It seems that day by day I feel almost comfortable with the girls around him. He persevered despite my continuous annoyances over the past
          several years, so I guess I should return the favor.
          <br><br>
          “I’m good,” I said, smiling at him. “Thanks... and you’re right on time.”
          <br><br>
          “Oh?” Tsukushi wanders about.
          <br><br>
          I handed over the folder to Ona-san. “Contained thereof is the proposal for Nyo’s birthday on Tuesday, with preparations starting tomorrow
          Sunday. Sayuri is still currently preparing the tables ahead of schedule.”
          <br><br>
          “Hm, who did this?”
          <br><br>
          “Elise,” I answered. “She handed that to me because she’s been tired lately. I mean, she did most of the work, so I guess she needs energy
          for tomorrow.”
          <br><br>
          “Alright,” he said, browsing through the paperwork as we sat on our chairs.
          <br><br>
          Time went by, and he laid the folder on the table. “There’s two things I want to talk about: The first being that we’re almost hours before 
          12 o’clock, and second being... that. I don’t know if we can still manage to get them done before Tuesday.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah,” I nod. “I could only figure that we need to be busy by a lot in order to complete the task in no time. Then we have to rest early
          afterwards.”
          <br><br>
          “M- maybe I can help,” Tsukushi raises her hand, catching his attention. Ona-san looks pleased.
          <br><br>
          “Maybe I can provide some suggestions before we get started with this. I mean, this looks nice, but... is it possible that we add some other
          resemblances of other girls in the perimeter? It might seem unfair to others if it’s just Nyo, right?”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, I was just thinking of the same thing,” he said, scratching his head. “It’ll give others more recognition in this manner.”
          <br><br>
          Tsukushi and I nod at that idea. “Well then, what will be your verdict?”
          <br><br>
          There is a long pause as he reviews the proposal for the last time. Tsukushi just gazes at him as I tap my fingers on the table. “Ah,” he said,
          “With the littlest details already in place, all I can say is...”
          <br><br>
          “Is... ?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          He nods in agreement. “Let’s do this.”
          <br><br>
          <b>POV: Owner</b>
          <br><br>
          It’s already the start of Nyotengu’s special week. Everyone seems busy with preparing the decorations, sound systems, and the amenities.
          Helping the girls here and there, the decorations were a perfect fit.
          <br><br>
          “There we go,” I said, finishing the vines. They all adorn in colors of red, brown and pink.
          <br><br>
          Ayane glances in awe. “Those were some nice tri-color you got there. Would it get them some recognition this way?”
          <br><br>
          “I think so. Where’s Fiona, by the way?”
          <br><br>
          Kasumi taps on my shoulder. “She’s at the Nikki Beach. Word is, she’s waiting for you there.”
          <br><br>
          “Alright,” I said, stretching my arms before I went.
          <br><br>
          “Thanks for the help,” said the Kunoichi Sisters simultaneously, bowing at me before I left.
          <br><br>
          At the Nikki Beach, Fiona was tending to the so-called Lady Flags when I saw some laying about. Looks like she was confused on where to put the
          flag to which spot. Truth be told, I printed them myself many times so that we can plaster them in some areas. I think that the Nikki Beach is
          just perfect for the whole lineup since I used it for photography sessions before. “Do you need some help over there?” I ask, patting her head.
          <br><br>
          “Ah! O- Ouji-sama,” Fiona immediately stood up, facing my direction. “Yes, I definitely do need some help with this... I don’t know what goes to
          which spot.”
          <br><br>
          “Let me see the plans,” I said, carrying the paperwork. It contains the information on where to put one flag to which spot. We started working
          on it right away afterwards.
          <br><br>
          <i>A few minutes later...</i>
          <br><br>
          “Whew! That was so close,” Fiona slumps down, exhausted. “How do you get to figure out what goes where, anyway?”
          <br><br>
          “It was hard,” I said, looking at the plans. “But if you’re thoroughly analyzing the plans, then that’ll be easy.”
          <br><br>
          She chuckled about it. “Surely you got used to doing this kind of stuff before.”
          <br><br>
          I nod in agreement. “Yeah... I did some of the hardest stuff which involves moving the furniture during my adolescence period.”
          <br><br>
          We both sigh in relief, knowing that we finished the job in no time. “Actually... Ouji-sama,” Fiona holds my hand, her face appears flushed.
          “What do you think of the chemistry we had so far? Is it any better?”
          <br><br>
          Did she just... ask that out of the blue? “Hm?”
          <br><br>
          “Sorry if I tend to ask that sometimes... I was just thinking if I could still do something to make you feel swoon for me...”
          <br><br>
          I chuckle at that response. “Even today, you’re still thinking about that?”
          <br><br>
          “Huh?”
          <br><br>
          I lean in closer, kissing her forehead. “I know what you’re thinking, you want to take me on a date?”
          <br><br>
          “Wha-”
          <br><br>
          I just smile at her with delight. “We can do that every day if you wish~”
          <br><br>
          Her face appears red. “O... Ouji-sama...”
          <br><br>
          <i>Several years ago...</i>
          <br><br>
          It’s my third year at the Venus Island, and it looks like the girls are getting along with each other. Except for Nagisa, that is, at the time.
          What really concerns me is that Fiona appears super clingy for some odd reason, except in some situations.
          <br><br>
          “Ona-sama~” she greets in a rather cutesy tone.
          <br><br>
          “Yes?”
          <br><br>
          “Do you have anything planned out for today?”
          <br><br>
          “None at the moment,” I said, tending to my clothes. “Do you have any?”
          <br><br>
          By appearance, she wears a white slit one-piece with pink accessories on the sides. She wears earrings this time, adorned in colors of velvet
          and purple. Although as simple as it looks, she still wears a tiara that was given to her from the previous Owner. <b><i>For reference, see
          Part 1 of the Inside Story series, Admirant of the Past.</i></b> “How do I look?” She asked.
          <br><br>
          “You’re looking better every day, I guess,” I said, glancing in awe. “You still have the same tiara he gave to you.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah,” said Fiona. “It was kinda like a little gift for me before I went back home to the kingdom.”
          <br><br>
          “I can see that,” I chuckle.
          <br><br>
          “In that case, can you take me on a date?” She gazes at me as she leans forward, awaiting my response.
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          “I’m not sure about that, but...”
          <br><br>
          She suddenly holds me close to her bosom. “Pretty please?”
          <br><br>
          “Alright, alright, I get it!” I chuckle, patting her head. “Well then, when should we start?”
          <br><br>
          “Right now,” she winks at me.
          <br><br>
          At this point, I’m not sure on what to respond, considering I haven’t been into dates before. I wasn’t used to hanging out around girls because
          of my busy schedule, except for events like Valentine’s Day. Looking at Fiona, it’s very clear that I should hang out more often, aside from
          checking on their conditions every few hours.
          <br><br>
          ... maybe I should check up on Nagisa after this one.
          <br><br>
          “I know a place,” she holds my hand, taking me to the jungle. At first glance, it looks quite nice. The birds chirping from above as we make our
          move, the Blue Robins coming in to perch on our heads. In the distance, we could see the volleyball net. Maybe they also used this for the
          Festivals, I’m not entirely sure.
          <br><br>
          In our direction, we could see the calm flow of the river as we sat on the edge. From there, goldfishes seem to light up in various colors. “They
          were a special species that is preserved on this island,” Fiona expresses her thoughts. “They lay their eggs there so that when the time comes,
          they’ll begin to populate and eventually get out of this river.”
          <br><br>
          “Mother Nature sure does wonders within her hands,” I nod.
          <br><br>
          With her head leaning on my shoulder, she begins to hum a song she’ll always remember. It was the same one that she told me was playing during
          her time at the kingdom, during her birthday. It felt so serene, she didn’t notice that she started to sing the lyrics.
          <br><br>
          “Ack!” She shrieks, backing away. I just chuckle.
          <br><br>
          “That’s a nice voice you got there; they were just like the first time I heard them,” I said, recalling that moment when I heard her voice for
          the first time. They always feel serene, like they want to put me to sleep.
          <br><br>
          Her face appears red. “Ona... sama...”
          <br><br>
          I clear my throat. “Should we go somewhere else?”
          <br><br>
          “Mhm!” She nods, immediately holding my hand as we get up. Cruising the outskirts of the jungle, we appear ourselves at the foot of the volcano.
          “From what I heard, this volcano has been dormant for a long time. Hopefully it stays that way, I can’t imagine what would happen if it erupts.”
          <br><br>
          “Regardless if we think it’s dormant or not, it’s best to be prepared for these kinds of situations,” I said, gazing at the peak. “I don’t
          wanna imagine what would happen if we don’t.”
          <br><br>
          She nods, agreeing with my sentiment.
          <br><br>
          As we headed back to the mansion, Koharu was waiting for us at the kitchen, making some tea. “Ona-sama? Fiona-sama?”
          <br><br>
          Fiona bows at her. “Koharu-sama.” I nod, peering at the table.
          <br><br>
          “It’s a special tea that I made,” she handed over the tea to us. “I hope you like it.”
          <br><br>
          I’m the first to sip through the tea. As soon as I gulp the liquid, I feel a bit... odd. “What blend did you use for this?”
          <br><br>
          “Just a fresh blend of Cocoa and Jasmine... I was trying different ingredients to find out which one is good.”
          <br><br>
          “You’re quite good,” Fiona said, sipping her tea. “The only thing left is some sugar... and not just sugar, washed sugar at best.”
          <br><br>
          Koharu smiles at the given feedback. I soon realized, “We don’t have any washed sugar in the first place.”
          <br><br>
          “Don’t worry about it. Any sugar is fine enough, I just prefer washed because I’ve been judging on things like this before,” Fiona smiles.
          <br><br>
          “Ah,” I nod. “So you were a judge of sweets?”
          <br><br>
          “All sorts of culinary goodies, yes.”
          <br><br>
          <i>The following evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          I have just been done with my work when Fiona approaches my direction. “What’s keeping you?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          “Nagisa wants to talk with you for a minute,” she said with a frown on her face. “She appears jealous or something.”
          <br><br>
          I sigh, patting her shoulder. “Alright, please have a good sleep.”
          <br><br>
          Heading to Nagisa’s room, her face appears sunken. On her table were a bunch of notes and drawings of the girls. As soon as I’m about to
          approach the table to check, she immediately grabs my hand, putting it on her chest. “Nagii, what the-”
          <br><br>
          “Keep quiet,” she silently pleads, sighing deeply. “I just want you to look out for me for a while.”
          <br><br>
          I just smile, slowly taking my seat as I fix her hair. “Are you alright?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          “Almost,” said Nagisa, fondling my hand. “I just feel... alone, no one to turn to, no one to rant out about my feelings.”
          <br><br>
          “You could at least tell me about it-”
          <br><br>
          “That’s the problem, I just don’t know what to tell you!” She immediately looks up to see me, tears flowing through her cheeks. “Everyone
          just seems to cling onto you, while I’m just here, trying my best to figure out how to get close to you. Am I doing something wrong... ?”
          <br><br>
          I close my eyes, my hands cupping her cheeks as I wipe them tears off. “Tell me, are you still guilty about it?”
          <br><br>
          She slowly nods, sniffing on occasion.
          <br><br>
          “I’m...” I slowly switch seats, this time, sitting on her bed. Immediately, she puts me into a deep embrace, sobbing as loud as she can.
          “I know... please let them all out,” I said, trying to soothe her with the best I can.
          <br><br>
          <i>Present day...</i>
          <br><br>
          That afternoon, Nagisa and Fiona can be seen playing at the coast while I watch over them, sweetie Helen on my left. “They sure were having
          fun,” I said, smiling in delight.
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, just look at them. Years of suffering because of the commotion and now they’re acting like literal sisters. How could you make that
          work so effortlessly?” Helena gazes at me.
          <br><br>
          “A lot of effort to listen to both sides, I guess.”
          <br><br>
          “Fair enough.”
          <br><br>
          As we are gazing at the sunset, Tsukushi slowly sits on my right. By appearance, she’s in her Pure White Slit One-Piece that I gave to her
          a few days ago. “How’d the manga go?” Helena asks.
          <br><br>
          “Pretty good, I guess...” Tsukushi fidgets her fingers.
          <br><br>
          I softly pat her head, her face turning to a smile as she gazes at me. “Since we’re done with that, we can go back to the usual activities
          we did before.”
          <br><br>
          “Like taking me on a date?” asked Tsukushi, making Helena shriek.
          <br><br>
          “That already?!”
          <br><br>
          I chuckle. “I mean, I can take all of you on a single date, if you wish.”
          <br><br>
          After I muster that sentence, her face immediately goes red. “Ona-san...”
          <br><br>
          Misaki immediately jumps in on the fun, her literal sister (Nagisa) splashing her with water. By appearance, she wears a heavily-revealing
          Daiquiri. Tamaki and Luna can be seen at the café in their Labyrinth; Monica, Marie and Honoka in their Fashionable One-Piece; Koharu,
          Kokoro and Momiji in their Yukata; the others in their Champs Elysees. Helen is in her Platinum Fizz, Fiona and Nagisa in their Pixie, and
          I’m in my usual islander clothing. I should try something new and fashionable this week.
          <br><br>
          My phone rang a few minutes later. “I should take this call. I’ll be back in a jiffy.”
          <br><br>
          Revealing the screen is a phone number that I haven’t contacted in a while. Clearing my throat, I try to answer the call. “This is the Owner
          of the Venus Island, how can I help you?”
          <br><br>
          “This is Christie,” a woman spoke on the other line, introducing herself. “How is your wife Helena Douglas?”
          <br><br>
          “What?” I slightly panicked, but quickly regained composure. “Oh, she’s alright; what is it with you? And how do you know about my
          relationship with her?”
          <br><br>
          “I just want to tell you to keep an eye on her,” she said, her voice indicating that she might be frowning. “I don’t want anything bad to
          happen to her. And please tell her I’m really sorry about what happened a long time ago, and that I have to bear the consequences.”
          <br><br>
          “Would that be alright with her?”
          <br><br>
          “I’m sure she will,” said Christie, sniffing in defeat. “I just sent you an Email just in case you need to talk to me in the future. I have
          to go.”
          <br><br>
          “Christie! Wai-” I got cut off as she hung up the phone call. “She hung up... what is she up to?”
          <br><br>
          “Is everything alright?” Helena immediately went in to check up on me, worried about what happened. “Someone disturbing you or... ?”
          <br><br>
          “No no no, it’s nothing. I have to tell you something important, though.”
          <br><br>
          “Are you talking about Christie?” She tilts her head. It seems that she knew about the conversation I had; or that she heard me as the
          line hung up, and that she knew her a long time ago. “What did she tell you?”
          <br><br>
          “I, uh...” I immediately held her hand as I prepared myself to tell her about the phone call. <b><i>This continuation will be in a future

          <br><br>
          <i>That evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          We’re almost done with the supplies when Nyotengu hands me a paper. It has an illustration of ourselves, signed by Nagisa. “Did she make
          this?” I ask.
          <br><br>
          “No idea,” she shrugs, sighing as she expresses her sentiment. “I usually tend to celebrate this week for myself, but... seeing that picture,
          makes me think of how we got this far. The things we do every day, the struggles we faced that lead us to victory, and most of all, your
          sacrifice that kept us living for years to come. I couldn’t think of another option than to celebrate this special day with the family I’ll
          be forever bound to for the rest of my life.”
          <br><br>
          I smiled upon hearing that. “I’m very sure Nagisa can appreciate her own drawing. I’ll admit, it looks quite nice. We just need to have some
          colors and we’re good.”
          <br><br>
          From afar, Misaki and Kanna can be seen chattering about while they prepare the next set of tables for the sound system. Fiona, Momiji and
          Monica are preparing the fireworks atop the S.S. Royal Fiona III. Koharu is seen tending to the cloths that will be decorated on the tables
          and chairs, adorned in colors of dark purple and red, with other colors matching the girls’ palettes on the edges.
          <br><br>
          “I should head inside, I have to tend to the cake,” I said, hurriedly running as Helen was just halfway done with the cake.
          <br><br>
          “I was just looking at the schematics... I’m not sure if this part goes here,” she ponders, her finger pointing to the middle section.
          <br><br>
          “Let’s see here...” I inspect the schematics. “Yeah, that looks good in my book.”
          <br><br>
          <i>Ten-o’clock in the evening at the Venus Island...</i>
          <br><br>
          Everyone is extremely exhausted as we’re pushing ourselves to our limits to complete almost everything. Actually, only the mansion is left
          to be decorated, and then we’re all set for Tuesday.
          <br><br>
          The cake is in refrigeration, the sound systems are confirmed for working, the tables and chairs are set, and the posters are all laid about.
          We’re just laying on the ground next to a bonfire to keep us warm. Fiona, Tsukushi, Nyotengu and Helena were laying beside me, the others in
          their chosen locations. The ship was decorated with LED lights, and fireworks were attached to the top of it.
          <br><br>
          As for me, well, I should plan on what to wear before Tuesday midnight. I don’t have time to react by now, because we’re just super tired
          that we have to take a rest as early as possible.
          <br><br>
          “We should get started on that by six,” Helena suggests. “That should give us time in the last-minute to prepare your clothing.”
          <br><br>
          “6am. You got it,” I said, taking down notes. “But, what about your outfits?”
          <br><br>
          “We’ve been set up for that,” Nyotengu pats my stomach. “We had our clothes to wear for that occasion, and I have my Platinum Kegon ready to
          go.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s good to know.”
          <br><br>
          “Should we have some activities to brighten up Tuesday? I mean, it could be better,” Fiona suggests. “How about who gets to dance gracefully
          like I do?”
          <br><br>
          Tsukushi chuckles upon that suggestion. “Some girls do suck at dancing, you know.”
          <br><br>
          “But it’s worth trying,” she smiles back, patting Tsukushi’s head.
          <br><br>
          “I somehow suck at dancing, but I’ll do my best,” I said, stretching my arms and legs as I yawn. “So, that calls for the night. We should get
          breakfast by five, then do the last part an hour later. Goodnight, everyone.”
          <br><br>
          Nyotengu and Helena kiss my cheeks. “Goodnight, sweetie.”
          <br><br>
          “Goodnight, Ona-sama,” Tsukushi said, yawning as she placed her arm on my stomach.
          <br><br>
          “Oyasuminasai, Ouji-sama,” said Fiona, holding my left hand.
          <br><br>
          The others follow suit, chanting their goodnights as they sleep soundly. Looking at the skies, I’m just as excited as they were because this
          is gonna be one of the greatest things that happened in my life. Looking back at how I managed to handle the three, I have to wonder what
          opportunities lie within them as we continue with our activities.
          <br><br>
          In that sense, should I call them the Admirers from this point onward?
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          <i>Monday morning...</i>
          <br><br>
          It’s 4:45am when I got up. “Looks like I’m the first to wake up this time,” I said, stretching my arms and legs. The bonfire is still lit up
          after hours of use, so it’s kinda bad if I try to put it out.
          <br><br>
          I immediately head to the mansion to prepare today’s dish, but there’s nothing in the fridge, aside from the birthday cake.
          <br><br>
          Slowly, I can see Sayuri tending to the dish together with Nagisa. “Knock knock,” I said, knocking on the door.
          <br><br>
          The second they notice that I knock, Sayuri immediately opens the door. “Ona-chan,” she greets. “Good morning. How’s your sleep?”
          <br><br>
          “Ah, I’m good,” I said. “Why early?”
          <br><br>
          “We have to prepare the Manjū ahead of breakfast as Helena intended,” said Nagisa, preparing the delicacy. “Do you want a taste?”
          <br><br>
          “Oh sure, I’ll do that after I wash my face.”
          <br><br>
          “Sure,” Sayuri beams at me. “We’ll be waiting~”
          <br><br>
          Immediately I head to the kitchen sink, washing my face. I feel a bit fresh this time, since I’ve been busier since last week.
          <br><br>
          I head back to the room where Sayuri and Nagisa were to taste some Manjū that they made. Chewing for at least a few seconds, my mind flashes
          back to the time when Helena treated me to the same thing. “That was delicious,” I said with a smile on my face.
          <br><br>
          “Thank you,” smiles Nagisa. “We actually got a bunch of them laid out already.”
          <br><br>
          “That’s good,” I said. “That should be our breakfast for the day. I’ll go ahead and make some coffee blend at the café, then we’ll meet with
          the rest there.”
          <br><br>
          They both nod as I leave for the café. From there, I can see Nyotengu looking at the containers. “Anything interesting before I take the blend?”
          <br><br>
          “Oh,” she gasps upon gazing at me. “I was just wondering if Aloe and Jasmine themselves can suit my taste. I mean, I haven’t tried them before.”
          <br><br>
          “Ah. Would you like some?”
          <br><br>
          “Oh sure.”
          <br><br>
          Just before I take another step, Helena steps in. “So, what’s our breakfast for today?”
          <br><br>
          “Oh,” I turned around, kissing her cheek. “We’ll have some Japanese Manjū that’s based on your own recipe the other day. Nyo would have some
          Jasmine and Aloe, how about you?”
          <br><br>
          “M- Manjū?!” Nyotengu shrieks.
          <br><br>
          I chuckle as I turn to see her. “It should be good, I guess.”
          <br><br>
          “We’ll have some Cappuccino, please,” said Helena, looking at the menu.
          <br><br>
          “Alright, Cappuccino and Jasmine-Aloe coffee blend, coming right up!” I said, summoning the ingredients. They’ve been kept in a separate
          container and refrigerated to perfection.
          <br><br>
          Taking the ingredients out, I begin to take my hand at making the perfect Cappuccino first. I’ve been practicing for years and I want to see
          if I already got the blend right the first time. As more girls start to wake up, they begin to wonder what that blend tastes like.
          <br><br>
          Immediately after serving the Cappuccino a good five minutes later, I set for the Jasmine-Aloe coffee blend that Nyotengu suggested. Putting
          two cups on the table, I carefully laid out the ingredients together in an intimate manner similar to what I had with Helen during our
          honeymoon. (I’m not quite sure why that’s relevant, though.)
          <br><br>
          Pouring over some hot water, I give the blend a little sizzle. “Alright, blends are done. Main and Sub, please distribute the Cappuccinos to
          the others.”
          <br><br>
          “Aye,” Nyo and Helen said, handing the mugs to the girls as I prepared the table to put the custom coffee blend. When they’re done, they sit
          on their chairs, their provided mug in hand.
          <br><br>
          Sayuri and Nagisa went ahead to distribute their Manjū that’s based on Helena’s recipe. Everyone seems to enjoy them as they smile in delight.
          <br><br>
          “This is delicious,” Helena said, amazed by the delicacy. “I can’t believe they base them on my recipe.”
          <br><br>
          “Couldn’t agree more,” said Nyotengu, whose Japanese Manjū is her absolute favorite.
          <br><br>
          I nod, taking a good bite. “Mhm. I hope they make more of these, I’m kinda planning that we have to make ourselves a bakery after this special
          week.”
          <br><br>
          <i>6am...</i>
          <br><br>
          “Alright, seems everyone is ready for the finale,” I said my salutations. “We need to provide the mansion a new makeover in response to this
          event.”
          <br><br>
          “Well then, let’s get going!!!” Nyotengu raises her fist, everyone running towards the mansion with the provided materials. We soon follow
          suit, doing the makeover on the mansion’s rooftops.
          <br><br>
          We have taken the chances to color the whole mansion in a graphical mixture of dark purple, red, sky blue, and white. (For those who don’t
          know, those four colors were the flagship colors of #MamaNyoSquad.)
          <br><br>
          <i>Approaching noon...</i>
          <br><br>
          We’re almost done with the outside (also bearing to the garden while we’re there) when I take a bottle of water. “What’s our lunch?”
          <br><br>
          “Philippine Adobo,” said Momiji, who just came out from the kitchen. She appears sweaty. “After this, we’ll cover the inside.”
          <br><br>
          “I think it’s better to have as little adjustments as possible,” said Nyotengu, carrying us down to the ground. “We’ll just clean the mess
          inside and reorganize some stuff, and do little decors here and there.”
          <br><br>
          “Yeah, the inside looks nice already.” I nod. “I already renovated the wallpapers last month.”
          <br><br>
          “Then that’s good to know,” Nagisa said, holding a box. “This should come in handy.”
          <br><br>
          “What does that contain?”
          <br><br>
          “Some unused clothes that might fit your figure,” she adds. “We’ve already done the digging and fixing the clothes just in time for the
          occasion.”
          <br><br>
          “Alright, I’ll get to them by the evening. We’ll eat first, then do the cleaning.”
          <br><br>
          Back at the dining area, we’re enjoying the meal as Nyotengu, Helena and I tend to the drinking water. “This is delicious,” Hitomi said.
          <br><br>
          And so did Tina, who has been sweating a lot lately in the backyard. <b><i>She’ll have a little cameo for this Inside Story ahead of her
            debut, which will happen this 2022 on the Japanese Edition of DOAXVV.</i></b> “How long have you been making this, Nagisa?”
          <br><br>
          Nagisa chuckles at that response. “I’ve done that through years of experience, Miss Tina,” she said. “A lot of experience and influence to
          boot.”
          <br><br>
          “The blends you made with this dish are absolutely wonderful! I can’t wait to try more of your Filipino delicacies!” Exclaims Honoka.
          <br><br>
          At this point, Nagisa is very pleased by the feedback. “Don’t worry, I’ll try to make more of the related delicacies in the future; but for
          now, we’ll just stick with this Adobo dish.”
          <br><br>
          <i>After lunch...</i>
          <br><br>
          We’re back to cleaning the whole mansion in preparation for Nyotengu’s birthday. Then, in the middle of cleaning the Suite, something strange
          happened: On the floor lies her hair ornaments--the Kanzashi. (The Kanzashi (簪) are hair ornaments used in traditional Japanese hairstyles.
          It refers to a wide variety of accessories, including: Long, rigid hairpins; barrettes; fabric flowers and fabric hair ties.)
          <br><br>
          “Why are these in here?” I wonder, steadily putting them on the bed. Going back to the spot, I opened the envelope which happened to be from...
          “Bankotsubo?”
          <br><br>
          Trying to read the note a couple of times, it’s probably written in a language I don’t understand. And probably the others can’t understand it,
          too. “I can’t read this... but Nyo can, I guess.”
          <br><br>
          After I’m done with the Suite, I went out of the mansion to see the girls chattering about. Fiona and Helena were discussing the activities
          during the event, and Nyotengu was just sitting on the bench, gazing at my direction.
          <br><br>
          Immediately, I hand over the Kanzashi to her, alongside the note. “Can you at least give me a general idea on what was said in the note?”
          <br><br>
          “Oh,” she opens the envelope, the ornaments on her right. “It’s a custom-made one that Bankotsubo made for my special day, but was never used.
          It was just sitting there for ages until one of his servants found out about this Island. As prestigious as it is, he doesn’t want to stay
          there because he has some work to do. In response, he left this note expressing his eternal gratitude and is wishing for more special days to
          come.”
          <br><br>
          “But what about the writings? How come you get to read them effortlessly?”
          <br><br>
          “I’m a Tengu,” she gazes at me. “I can speak even the demon languages. And I try my best at translating them for mere commoners to understand.”
          <br><br>
          “Ah,” I realize.
          <br><br>
          “But since I’m here, I might as well try my hand at other human languages at once.”
          <br><br>
          As I sit beside her, I take a deep sigh. “You know, being a Tengu and a sign of beauty, no wonder why you’re called the sexiest Tengu they’ve
          ever seen.”
          <br><br>
          She chuckles at that response. “You flatter me.”
          <br><br>
          “I mean, that’s true,” I smile at her. “You need to maintain that representation so that everyone can follow your footsteps. Just saying.”
          <br><br>
          She slowly blushes upon receiving the response. “Ona-dono...”
          <br><br>
          <i>That evening...</i>
          <br><br>
          “We’re almost hours away until the main event, let’s make sure it counts,” I express my salutations. “We have supper all ready to go, and when
          we’re done, I want all of us to change outfits at once.”
          <br><br>
          “But what about other things we need to do?” Asked Marie Rose.
          <br><br>
          “We already did them ahead of time, so there’s nothing else for us to do aside from preparing ourselves. Now let’s get going.”
          <br><br>
          As the girls and I sat beside the round table, everyone bowed their heads as I wished upon the stars, “May I hope that whatever happens after
          midnight will be a good one.”
          <br><br>
          As we enjoy the supper, I look over the surroundings once more to make sure everything is good to go. We spent a good 53 minutes of supper,
          one of the longest feasts we have thus far.
          <br><br>
          Tsukushi and Fiona were the first to leave the area, heading towards the mansion. Nyotengu followed suit, making sure that they were alright.
          I soon follow as well after a good five minutes later as Helena tends to the others.
          <br><br>
          I head upstairs to the Suite to find the three standing there, waiting for me.
          <br><br>
          “Ona-sama,” gasps Fiona.
          <br><br>
          “O- Ona... san...” stutters Tsukushi.
          <br><br>
          “Oh... Ona-dono,” Nyotengu has a frown on her face as she looks down on the floor.
          <br><br>
          “What’s going on? We’re supposed to be changing clothes before the party,” I said, looking at them with a deep concern on my face.
          <br><br>
          The three began holding hands with each other, nodding to the same thought. They then said simultaneously, “Can you please call us your
          Admirers from now on?”
          <br><br>
          “What?”
          <br><br>
          “I mean, we admire you for so long,” Fiona said, cupping my left cheek as they inch towards my direction.
          <br><br>
          “That we can’t stand it anymore,” Nyotengu follows suit, cupping my right cheek.
          <br><br>
          Immediately, Tsukushi pulls me into an embrace. “We have to repay you one way or another... even if it means we have to stay beside you all
          the time.”
          <br><br>
          “The three of you,” I contemplate, trying to look for possible ways to comfort them. “I, uh...”
          <br><br>
          “You don’t need to say anything,” they said. “Just please let us do it.”
          <br><br>
          Without any further notice, my body is all naked as they shut the doors. Tsukushi hands the cloth to Fiona, while Nyotengu tends to my figure
          with body powder. I could only close my eyes and not dare to see the strangest sight.
          <br><br>
          <i>A good five minutes later...</i>
          <br><br>
          “And it’s done,” they said, a mirror in front of them.
          <br><br>
          When I opened my eyes, I could only open my mouth in awe as I tended to the new threads they provided before noon. By appearance, on its top
          is a semi-transparent color of dark purple, and on the waistline reveals the palettes of the girls altogether. On its left chest is the
          letter N sewn in calligraphy, which represents Nyotengu. (For reference, see branding of #MamaNyoSquad.) The pants they provided are very
          comfortable, the colors matching the top. And the best part is that they’re coated in glitter, too.
          <br><br>
          “There’s a hidden feature that can only be triggered when the clock hits twelve,” Nyotengu emphasized, adjusting my hair.
          <br><br>
          “I’m not sure, but...”
          <br><br>
          As the four of us head back out to the open space with the Admirers in their respective, custom-made Kegons that match their palette (except
          for Nyo who’s in her Platinum Kegon; and I can confirm that she wore the special Kanzashi that Bankostubo gave to her this time), the girls
          immediately glance in awe. Helena slowly pulls me into an embrace like she wanted to do it years ago. The Admirers followed suit, and so did
          the others.
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          I think it’s kinda fashionable for now, but let’s see what happens when we hit midnight.
          <br><br>
          <i>11:55pm...</i>
          <br><br>
          “I’m already grateful that more than 8 years of perseverance and inspiration have already been paid off, and I’m excited for what lies ahead
          as we look forward to more years to come. May you join me in this greatest feat of our lives,” I express my salutations. On my left is Helena
          and Fiona, while on my right is Nyotengu and Tsukushi.
          <br><br>
          I then raise my wine glass. “I’m giving a toast... to the people whom I already consider my own family, the ones who persevered with me
          throughout these trying times, and the ones who chose to stay despite their aspirations for the greater good. I’m so grateful to be a part
          of this family, and I hope that all of you feel the same way as I do.”
          <br><br>
          “So, let’s all raise our glasses altogether,” said Helena, Nyotengu, Fiona and Tsukushi; as the others followed suit.
          <br><br>
          “Cheers!”
          <br><br>
          The last five minutes were full of magical surprises as we head ourselves to a new day. And now, the time has finally come...
          <br><br>
          “Ten!”
          <br><br>
          “Nine!”
          <br><br>
          “Eight!”
          <br><br>
          “Seven!”
          <br><br>
          “Six!”
          <br><br>
          “Five!”
          <br><br>
          “Four!”
          <br><br>
          “Three!”
          <br><br>
          “Two!”
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          “... one!!!”
          <br><br>
          The clock has hit Tuesday midnight, 12am. As the fireworks shine from the top of S.S. Royal Fiona III, the sound system immediately began
          playing <a href="javascript:play1()"><span style="background-color: #fff; color: #161224;"><b>the tune of her theme</b></span></a>.
          The lights began illuminating in various colors, and the night sky was tinted in dark-purple.
          <audio id="playAudio1" src="../../media/audio/20211119_1-2.mp3" width="0" height="0"></audio>
          <script type="text/javascript">
            function play1() {
              document.getElementById("playAudio1").play();
            }
          </script>
          <br><br>
          Gazing at the mansion, the walls begin animating in colors similar to the Admirers; as the calligraphy letter N was shown at the front.
          <br><br>
          Nyotengu, Fiona and Tsukushi, among others, were shocked when my special outfit glowed out of nowhere. I slowly turn to face Nyo, wiping
          the tears off her cheeks.
          <br><br>
          Immediately, she presses her lips against mine, reigniting a new symbol of hope for everyone at the island. Tsukushi follows suit, then
          Fiona...
          <br><br>
          ... then Helena.
          <br><br>
          As we kissed passionately under the moonlight, more fireworks began to launch in the air, forming a sparkly illustration of ourselves as
          a family.
          <br><br>
          The family whom I already call my own.
          <br><br>
          The following minutes were nothing but party as we feast and dance on the centerstage, with Nyotengu--the Birthday Girl--leading the pact.
          Tsukushi and Fiona soon follow, then Helena, Nagisa... the list goes on and on. I could only wonder if we have to do this every day, but
          it’s up to fate to see if I’m destined to do it again.
          <br><br>
          Unfortunately, we have to rest easy five hours later because tomorrow is another day. At the Suite, we laid ourselves around the bed, with
          myself at the center.
          <br><br>
          (Everyone might think this is already a ground for harem, but... I don’t think so. It’s just that I already got used to sleeping with all
          of them at once since they’re my family and all.)
          <br><br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          <i>Tuesday morning, 8am...</i>
          <br><br>
          It’s time to have another journal entry regarding what I have achieved so far. As I write the words, I feel tranquility knowing that
          everything I do is already for the sake of the island, regardless of issues being laid out.
          <br><br>
          I feel a natural breeze as I’m about to finish the note and look for the biography book. Then, there’s a knock on the door. “Please come
          in,” I said.
          <br><br>
          Entering the room were indeed the Admirers themselves: Fiona (the Past), Tsukushi (the Present), and Nyotengu (the Future). As they gazed
          into each other’s eyes, they all said at once, “Ona-sama?”
          <br><br>
          I turn back, standing up from my seat, slowly pulling them into an embrace as their tears fall from their cheeks.
          <br><br>
          In the biography book, a photo of the Venus Island Family can be seen next to 1x1 pictures of the Admirers themselves; and at the bottom,
          the picture of the five of us alongside Helena.
          <br><br>
          In the journal, there concludes the following:
          <br><br>
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> The Admirers are complete, the celebration is still ongoing. And today, I’m here to
            highlight what happened:
            <br><br>
            First off, the Past. Fiona had a lot of admiration on her hands to the point that she wants to relive it again and again. Thankfully, I
            got everything laid out, so it’s all fine and dandy. But what intrigues me is that despite her happiness, there’s still some sadness
            between those experiences that I should take a deeper look into.
            <br><br>
            Second, the Present. Tsukushi is known to have obliviousness all over the place to the point that she discouraged herself to do most of
            the things that she’s supposed to do. The only wish that she wants to grant before she finally makes a choice is to complete the manga,
            in which I volunteered to revamp and make it look like new. She has a deep interest in romance, so I laid it like that, and time goes by,
            and here we are. The series is done, her job is complete... but she chose to stay.
            <br><br>
            And finally, the Future. Mama Nyo is known to have deep affection towards people she met, even at the island. I don’t know if that
            contributes to her concurrent attitude, but one thing I truly know is that despite the odds, she still remains persistent. Her status in
            that regard peaked on her special week, with me in the picture. I can sense her admiration not just in romantic aspects, but other things
            that she didn’t know just yet. But I guess it’s up to me to figure out if I should tell her what she truly felt. And oh, Bankotsubo... I
            forgot to mention. He mentioned that special Kanzashi that Nyo forgot to wear (that she wore during the party, by the way), which
            apparently fits the occasion. I wonder what magic lies within that decoration... we’ll have to see.
            <br><br>
            For now, this is what I’ll write. I hope I can write more if there are some valuable experiences I can encounter, and hopefully, I can
            get in touch with the Admirers in an intimate manner sometime in the future. But this is what my energy reserved for the meantime, and
            I’ll leave it at that.
            <br><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          Nyotengu turned to the journal, and added the following words:
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> I’m so glad that I already became an Admirer I wished to bestow, thanks to him. I
            could’ve sworn that I got used to it once in a while, but not as intimate as this.
            <br><br>
            I look forward to better days with Ona-dono.
            <br><br>
            <div style="text-align: right;">Nyotengu, Admirant of the Future</div>
          </div>
          <br>
          ...
          <br><br>
          Eventually, Fiona and Tsukushi follow suit, writing their own notes on the next page:
          <br><br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> I’m just proud that Ona-sama still remembers what experiences I had despite the
            grievances and everything bad. I won’t forget what he did at my party... a way to make me remember the grandest birthday of my life.
            <br><br>
            And now that I became one of the Admirers, not only is it my job to do what it takes to make him swoon for me, but I also need to make
            others admire the experiences that I had so that they can utilize it in their day-to-day basis.
            <br><br>
            <div style="text-align: right;">Fiona, Admirant of the Past</div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="journalWrite">
            <img src="../../media/svg/gfonts/edit.svg" alt=""> Manga is something I’m good at, although it has deteriorated over time. Thanks to
            Ona-san, I feel a bit better and became more lenient towards facing the toughest decisions. But I can’t just rely on his help all the
            time.
            <br><br>
            As the Admirant of the Present, I’ll be guiding the Past and the Future in reshaping the world around me... and around us. We may say
            that this is for the sake of the island, but to me... it’s for the sake of every nation.
            <br><br>
            And with intimate love that grows within the hearts of us three, we can be sure of more inspiring experiences to come.
            <br><br>
            <div style="text-align: right;">Tsukushi, Admirant of the Presnt</div>
          </div>
        </p>
