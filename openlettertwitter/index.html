      <h1>AN OPEN LETTER TO TWITTER</h1>

        Twitter has became the home of many opportunities that we don't know is possible. From memes to information
        about certain brands, and beyond -- it became the hub of what's known as the "Town Square of the People".
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, we won't even forget its mishaps and things that reshaped the platform throughout the years on
        a negative note -- drama, controversies, and even as far as exploitations that harm the users.
      </p>
      <p>
        We just learned about what happened with the management a few days ago, and we are very optimistic at first
        with the new management -- only to realize the scathed reality of it being its own pile of mess because of
        demanding workflows and things that other employees think is not really necessary to implement in the first
        place. Despite this, we still kept on our optimistic approach that things would turn around despite those
        events.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the course of these events that are currently unfolding, the public eye has already interpreted it as
        the "End of an Era for Twitter" as they deem know it. But on a personal level, we would say that we have grown
        much that we're establishing ourselves in our own right despite our accounts only being in the platform for a
        while. So, it's still in the best interest that we'll be staying on this platform while we work on other options.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, there won't be an Open Letter like this without any demands and/or questions, so let's get down with it:
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, why the layoff of the employees for such an overwhelming demand? If you're desperately trying to
        improve the services for the greater good of the people, then how come the employees are leaving en masse?
        Surely there's something wrong with the atmosphere, or -- as we've looked into the details as it unfolds -- it
        may be because of the demands that the employees can't stand it anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, the verification procedures and how Twitter Blue is connected to it. We've seen users being verified
        because they're subscribed to Twitter Blue, which caused a lot of dismay for others. In other cases, some critics
        pointed out that people who are on the negative side of things (like being scrutinized and/or accused of certain
        allegations that critics see fit) that deter public's interest with certain topics are verified because of this
        change. We understand the case as to how it's implemented, but why?
