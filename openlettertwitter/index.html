      <h1>AN OPEN LETTER TO TWITTER</h1>
      <p>Issued 20 November 2022 UTC</p>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Twitter has became the home of many opportunities that we don't know is possible. From memes to information
        about certain brands, and beyond -- it became the hub of what's known as the "Town Square of the People".
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, we won't even forget its mishaps and things that reshaped the platform throughout the years on
        a negative note -- drama, controversies, and even as far as exploitations that harm the users.
      </p>
      <p>
        We just learned about what happened with the management a few days ago, and we are very optimistic at first
        with the new management -- only to realize the scathed reality of it being its own pile of mess because of
        demanding workflows and things that other employees think is not really necessary to implement in the first
        place. Despite this, we still kept on our optimistic approach that things would turn around despite those
        events.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the course of these events that are currently unfolding, the public eye has already interpreted it as
        the "End of an Era for Twitter" as they deem know it. But on a personal level, we would say that we have grown
        much that we're establishing ourselves in our own right despite our accounts only being in the platform for a
        while. So, it's still in the best interest that we'll be staying on this platform while we work on other options.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, there won't be an Open Letter like this without any demands and/or questions, so let's get down with it:
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, why the layoff of the employees for such an overwhelming demand? If you're desperately trying to
        improve the services for the greater good of the people, then how come the employees are leaving en masse?
        Surely there's something wrong with the atmosphere, or -- as we've looked into the details as it unfolds -- it
        may be because of the demands that the employees can't stand it anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, the verification procedures and how Twitter Blue is connected to it. We've seen users being verified
        because they're subscribed to Twitter Blue, which caused a lot of dismay for others. In other cases, some critics
        pointed out that people who are on the negative side of things (like being scrutinized and/or accused of certain
        allegations that critics see fit) that deter public's interest with certain topics are verified because of this
        change. We understand the case as to how it's implemented, but why? We're supposed to believe that notability
        plays a big factor in determining if we should get verified.
      </p>
      <div class="notice">
        <h2>In response...</h2>
        <p>
          Our commitment to be notable and trustworthy for the community will always remain as one of the key factors in
          our brands, and with this, we take those factors very seriously. When we heard about the changes to Twitter's
          new verification procedures as outlined with its inclusion to Twitter Blue, it became clear that whether we get
          verified or not, it's still our duty to be notable in our own way.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>With this moving forward -- as #MamaNyoSquad, we're abstaining from the Twitter Blue Program.</strong>
          It would feel as if we're not in a position to represent a community which it will be away after a while. Such
          notability may not be effective in the long run.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Third, management issues and recent receptions from the public eye. We're recently become aware that recent layoffs
        (as pointed in the first factor) caused an upheaval across the public, and they firmly believe that the upper
        management are to be blamed for all the chaos -- which also are underpinned by constant memes surrounding the
        "alleged" demise of the platform. Would you firmly believe it was the case? Are there any other options that could
        possibly turn things around for the better good? As far as we're concerned, we also don't want this legacy to
        perish because of such issues, but what can we do about it?
      </p>
      <div class="notice">
        <h2>To Mr. Musk...</h2>
        <p>
          You've been a public figure that's notable because of your dedication to do something great. But as time goes by,
          so is your notoriety. What exactly happened, and how would you describe the recent situation as as of late?
        </p>
        <p>
          And if possible, how would you rectify to such an incredible amount of backlash on a positive note?
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Fourth, combat to scrutiny. As we're writing this, there's already the news stating that the Former President that
        encouraged the insurrection against the White House and the Electoral College last 6 Jan 2021 -- Donald Trump --
        will have his Twitter account reinstated back again by Mr. Musk. (By the time of issuance there's a high chance that
        it already has been done.) How would you -- as a company -- respond to such scrutinies, and how would you prevent
        such from happening that deter public interest -- without considering profits to boot? And what policies should be
        done in order to make this work?
      </p>
      <p>
        And fifth, the continuous development of the platform following the mass exodus. As per our findings, if these events
        keep happening, there's a high chance that it will become underdeveloped and out-of-date -- security vulnerabilities
        (commonly referred as being CVEs), if left unpatched, may leave the platform compromised. It's understandable that
        more people are needed to combat such vulnerabilities, but with this event still ongoing, how will you combat such?
      </p>
      <p>
        We understood that the new management will be tough, and we sympathize with you; but let's not forget that these (and
        other factors) exist and we need to maintain as much as we can in order for it to thrive further. Not to mention,
        having some adjustments to some features in response to the situation, but keeping some of the most important factors
        into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        We firmly believe and hope that there's still some good way out without some of these overwhelming demands and mass
        exodus happening on every corner. We might not know what might that be, and what changes you might implement as a
        platform, but let's hope that the values we shared throughout the years remain the same.
