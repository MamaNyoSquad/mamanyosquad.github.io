      <h1>KT Disclosure ðŸ’•</h1>
      <p style="font-weight: 300;"><i>Enforced 20 July 2021 UTC</i></p>
      <p>This information contains some general information and enforcing mechanisms regarding content originated from KOEI TECMO GAMES (and KT Holdings).</p>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        #MamaNyoSquad is a community-based, non-incorporating organization managed or operated by an individual or two that makes use of assets from other sources.
        <br><br>
        We understood the risk of some assets being classified as non-distributable materials, and we govern that the assets are handled with integrity in mind.
      </p>
      <h2>Handling the Assets</h2>
      <p>
        Most of the assets that are displayed on this website are not our sole property, therefore it is our responsibility to handle them without causing any harm to the parties involved.
        <br><br>
        The way we handle the assets may depend on the situation given: Either we display the assets, disclosing the attribution from another source or property; or make our own rendition of existing assets given the amount of time allotted before the display of such assets.
        <br><br>
        We may also acquire additional assets that may not have been disclosed to the public before a specific date. As such, we will apply a disclaimer and/or additional security measures given as part of our handling measures.
      </p>
      <h2>Properties</h2>
      <p>
        We are complying with the best we can to ensure no damages have been warranted against the use of such assets.
        <br><br>
        We may be prompted to remove the assets and/or take down if they deem we violated their properties, with or without question. In case of infringement, please contact us by <a href="mailto:mamanyosquad@outlook.com">Email</a> or <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1335516811505254401" target="_blank">Twitter DM</a>.
        <br><br>
        We may also send them a formal permission to use the assets as long as such are not violated under such properties. Failure to do so, when prompted however, may result in what cited on paragraph two.
        <br><br>
        As such, we may resort to citing attributions and/or disclaimers for the meantime. See above section for information.
      </p>
      <h2>Additional Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may garner additional information that may or may not be related to the overall subject matter, such as news and social information.
        <br><br>
        As such, we may classify such information, although some may be moved to a different channel because of urgent reasons.
        <br><br>
        We may be using the assets in order to depict the information given. See section "Handling the Assets" for information. For intellectual properties, see above section.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Such assets that we displayed on this website are by no means our property, and we will take responibility for any damages given by such liabilities. NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED.
