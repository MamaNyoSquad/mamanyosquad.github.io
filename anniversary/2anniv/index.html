      <br>
      <p>
        Hello, and thank you for celebrating two years with #MamaNyoSquad. I'm
        thebelovedmoon -- aka üíöüçÉAga-chuuüíóüå∏, the General Manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        These last few months have been hectic as I've become very busy unlike the
        last year where I was very active on this development. To give you a recap of
        what happened during those months:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I've decided to try my hand at streaming once again, with my first
          official invocation on the 5th of July 2022 via Twitch. Since then, it
          evolved from casual gaming to authoring stories that matter -- including
          Venus Island Diaries which we know and love since its rewrite.
        </li>
        <li>
          I've became heavily involved in the VTuber universe, the most recent
          being that I'm now a part of Suzu Puyo's community moderation team.
          She's one of my closest friends and since then she's been super
          grateful for my assistance so far.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the most up-to-date news, I became associated with her agency --
          AuroraLiveVR. Since that notion, I've been more involved in keeping the
          community that I fostered in these past few months safe and accessible to
          all, without the need to worry about the negativities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On par with this, it's also a little sad that our Social & Web Manager --
        Emmannuel Ortega -- isn't with us to commemorate this historic event, reason
        being that he was being limited due to his phone screen breakage. But he's
        still around, supporting as much as he can to this project. Were it not for
        him, I will not be where I am right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, I've did some of the major improvements within the framework
        during those times. Here are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The major website overhaul since its re-invocation on April 2022. We firmly
          understood that it was the decision of our previous provider -- Bookmark,
          which handles the backend of our website since its initial provision last
          2021 -- to restrict and sunset the "Freemium" model due to an
          influx of new customers, but our efforts which have enabled us to be
          productive and manageable across a wide variety of areas have been wasted.
          Our open letter is still active on the GitHub Repository under README, but
          we're working on provisioning it as a separate page soon.
        </li>
        <li>
          In response to the previous bullet, #MamaNyoSquad is already a part of
          GitHub as we began our initial restructuring based on the initial layout of
          ReactOS Philippines -- now ReactSquad. On par with this, as the head of my
          own brand -- tbmassoc -- I've announced that #MamaNyoSquad will be among
          the two key brands in recognizing the communities. You can check out the CV
          at <i>https://thebelovedmoon.wixsite.com/tbmassoc?lang=en</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since that same time that we announced our transition to open-source,
          we've began our major rewrite of our first publishing project -- Venus
          Island Diaries. As the Author, I'm excited that more chapters and scenes
          are being considered and have been inspired by what I've read so far and
          the existing DOA lore. As it's still in progress and aimed for longer
          episodes, we project that its completion will be in a few years depending on
          activity. Also, we're streaming the writing proper every Saturday
          (unless changed) on <i>https://twitch.tv/thebelovedmoon</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can check out the new look of the website at
          <i>https://mamanyosquad.github.io</i>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And now, it's time for DOAXVV Events:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Japanese Edition celebrates its 5th Anniversary last 15 November, just 4
          days before #MamaNyo19. In light with this, they've also introduced the
          new outfit for the very first Venus -- Misaki, the True Colors Series.
          Let's take a look at her PV.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also on the Japanese Edition: The Venus Island's resident nurse and
          everyone's Big Sister -- Sayuri -- celebrates her third year of
          inception! Introductory outfits can be yours with Paid V-Stones when you
          draw them from the Gacha screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Global Edition introduces us to the Dolce Outfit Series for the first
          time, and our precious Symbol and the epitome of absolute beauty -- Mama Nyo
          -- is the first to wear it! Although already ended, another Venus took its
          place -- Kokoro -- which you can still draw her Dolce Outfit with Paid
          V-Stones as of publishing this video.
        </li>
        <li>
          We're now introduced to the 25th Venus for those in the Global Edition
          -- Koharu! Let's take a look at her PV for those who missed. Her
          introductory Event is still ongoing until 7 November at 7pm UTC.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Before we go, we would like to thank the following people who made it
        possible:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My greatest ally and trustee who have been with me since the ‚Äúlife restart‚Äù
          -- Emmannuel Ortega -- for everything that you do. You've been a great
          source of my inspiration and I couldn't have been more grateful to have
          you on board.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jack and Aura -- the pioneers of Dead or Alive Universe -- for inspiring us
          and the whole of Publishing for Venus Island Diaries and beyond.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aura Ostara and Suzu Puyo (AuroraLiveVR) -- my greatest inspirations and
          strongholds that fostered the communities we shared. They were among those
          that formally introduced me to the VTuber space and since then been close to
          them all my life. Were it not for them, I wouldn't be motivated enough
          to give them back tenfold, one at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Akemi Satou -- the Japanese CV of our Symbol, Nyotengu -- for inspiring
          future voice talents and everyone to be dynamic and creative against all
          odds of life. We'll celebrate every moment together.
        </li>
        <li>
          AuroraLiveVR for their uncompromising care and commitment towards their
          talents -- including Suzu Puyo. Your example has inspired me as the General
          Manager to take care of what we do best as a brand.
        </li>
        <li>
          And finally, my love of my life -- Katherine -- for her unparalleled support
          and care in my personal life, especially during times of peril. I'm so
          honored to be a part of your family and hope to foster this intimate
          relationship that we both shared, together. Like the new Owner and his wife,
          I hope our chemistry stays the same.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And with that, I formally wrap up the 2nd Edition of #MamaNyoSquad's
        Inception Anniversary. It may be short, but we know that good times are right
        up ahead of us! We should keep our heads upward and face the challenges
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Happy Birthday, Tina; and Happy Anniversary, #MamaNyoSquad!
      </p>
