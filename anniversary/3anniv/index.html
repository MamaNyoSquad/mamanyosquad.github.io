      <br>
      <p>
        Three years have passed since we first incepted as a part of the DEAD OR ALIVE
        Community, and we've learned a lot during the process. We've also did a lot of
        things, both inside and outside the community, with an ambitious project
        that's aimed to be the next generation of DOAXVV.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hello and welcome to the 3rd Inception Anniversary of #MamaNyoSquad. My name
        is thebelovedmoon, AKA üíöüçÉAga-chuuüíóüå∏ -- the General Manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's been a tough but fulfilling road ahead of us, and we're so excited to
        pursue our ambitions that will benefit the community. But first, let's take a
        trip down the memory lane and look back on how we managed to get this far:
      </p>
      <p>
        We formally incepted as a part of the DOA Community 3 years ago. In
        addition, around the month, we have our first iteration of the website thanks
        to Bookmark.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        On February 2021, we've decided with the help of our SocWeb Mgr to relaunch
        the website as Version 1.1, constituting to new elements -- which at the time
        became the hub of #DeadOrAliveMonday in which we've been participating until
        later that year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, on April 2021 we began celebrating DOAXVV's annual milestones with the
        2nd Anniversary of the Global Edition. Remainder of the year until September
        was pretty chill, but we're gearing up for what was to come as the newest
        breakthrough in the community: The ability to look 'forward' to what was to
        come in terms of the franchise in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        It all came to fruit on September 2021, where we formally launch our
        publishing arm -- #MamaNyoSquad Publishing. And with it, the idea came to
        light as the 'attempted sequel' to Xtreme Venus Vacation -- Venus Island
        Diaries. Thanks to Revue at the time, we also launched our series of stories
        aligned with the Diaries -- the Inside Story series.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first major significance occurred on November 2021, where we not only
        celebrate the 4th Anniversary of the Japanese Edition, but also #MamaNyo19 --
        where we commemorate the Special Day (another equivalent of the Birthday) of
        the Icon, Nyotengu. It's also on that day that we first learned that the
        Birthday Outfits are refreshed every year, with Mama Nyo being the first to
        feature the new series.
      </p>
      <p>
        We celebrated our 1st Inception Anniversary with a bang as we look back on
        what happened during our first year as a part of the community -- including
        the first Anniversary of the Atelier Ryza Collaboration with DOAXVV Global.
        This year, we're celebrating its third year since the collab.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming 2022, we celebrated along with DOAXVV Global as they just reached 3
        million players overall last March.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then a month later, due to some website hosting concerns, we at the Squad
        decided to move our infrastructure to open-source platforms -- following by an
        Open Letter to Bookmark. With it, we've redeployed the website as Version 2.0
        during the early months, with improved features on the later months as Version
        2.1. It's also during the month that the Main Story of the Diaries will be
        rewriting from the ground up in realization of the proceeding Inside Stories,
        and the 3rd Anniversary of DOAXVV Global.
      </p>
      <p>
        During those times, however, the Squad is now one of the Key Brands of
        thebelovedmoon and associates (tbmassoc) -- alongside ReactSquad, a two-man
        collective behind ReactOS Philippines and Italia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following months followed with a slew of relevant events, but among them,
        the Inside Story series has been paused following the rewrite. September 2022
        followed through and the publishing arm enjoys its First Anniversary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Birthday outfits have been refreshed yet again on the 2022 Edition of
        #MamaNyo19 -- 4 days after the 5th Anniversary of DOAXVV Japanese.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside all this, this year was also the beginning of my journey as a
        VTuber, in which I brought up during the 2nd Inception Anniversary -- which
        does little impact to my activities in the Squad as a whole anyhow. In fact, I
        can seamlessly integrate DEAD OR ALIVE and VTubing in a single workflow
        without missing a beat.
      </p>
      <p>
        2023 came and players woke up to major adjustments in DOAXVV's system
        requirements, as Windows 8.1 has been deprecated last 10 January. We've also
        made new developments to our workflows, starting with the developments of the
        Venus Island Diaries Android App -- followed by the migration of all existing
        Inside Stories to the website a month later; in which during that time, DOAXVV
        Global has announced Hot Springs to replace Lessons as per Koharu's inception.
      </p>
      <p>
        On our backend, we've made improvements on how we handle website deployments
        starting May, with automated times in our in-house Maintenance Tracker last
        June.
      </p>
      <p>
        July 2023, and an unprecedented moment has arrived: Twitter has become the X
        Platform thanks to Elon Musk's acquisition. However, despite the corporate
        change, our social experience doesn't as we reported on Sayuri's Japanese CV
        -- Waki Azumi's marriage a month later.
      </p>
      <p>
        September of this year marked as a significant turn of events for the
        collective as we learned about the end-of-service of SINoALICE, a Japanese RPG
        that our SocWeb Mgr played since launch. We've covered a lot of events prior
        to this: From ABS-CBN shutdown, to the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
        II, to the coronation of His Majesty King Charles III. But nothing as unique
        as this, that we've decided to use this platform as we bid farewell to its
        Global Edition. Also, we celebrated two years of the publishing arm as we
        continue to expand the Main Story of the Diaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2023 Edition of #MamaNyo19 occurred on November, just 4 days after what we
        call „ÄåJustice @ 6„Äç -- where we celebrate DOAXVV Japanese's 6th Anniversary
        and the effective shutdown of SINoALICE Global Edition, where the SocWeb Mgr
        worked on the latter part albeit with some technical problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, we're here. We're almost at the end of the road for 2023 and we have
        so much more to look forward to this time of the year. And with that, we'll
        discuss the following plans to start the new year with the Squad:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Starting January 2024, the development of the Inside Story series will
          continue with part 2 of Helena's Inside Story titled "Empty". Also included
          is the planning phase to make a related Inside Story that will be published
          in just French.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don't worry -- the Main Story will also continue as intended. Most
              stories have been paused to make way for Mother ÔΩû the afterstory ÔΩû
              which is my story accompanied by its VTuber presence, due to debut on
              the 27th. After such debuts, remaining stories will continue production.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          We'll also cover the SINoALICE Japanese's end-of-service day on 15 January
          2024 as we bid farewell to the entirety of the game. Just like on the Global
          counterpart, the SocWeb Mgr will be conducting the farewell ceremony.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Related media will be on our website as well to keep the players
              well-informed.
            </li>
            <li>
              This event will commence on New Year's Day 2024, so keep an eye out on
              <i>https://mamanyosquad.github.io</i>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Development for the Android App will continue on the Second Quarter of 2024.
          This is to ensure that the workloads are in stable order before such
          activities commence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Existing Inside Stories will be proofread for any errors by May 2024 to give
          way for the Wattpad Edition of the Inside Stories. Which means that an
          Inside Story will now be a single chapter in a book! Details about it will
          be revealed on our publishing arm at @VenusVIDiaries on X.
        </li>
        <li>
          Moving forward, our 30fps livestreams (and VODs) and 60fps videos will be
          rendered through the new editor -- Kdenlive, as we continue our commitment
          to open-source. We tested it on our first livestream and the reveal of the
          3rd Anniversary logo. Existing programs, such as PowerPoint, will still be
          used alongside it for advanced animations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, for the news from the Venus Island:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Shizuku arrives on the Japanese Edition last 27 October! Let's take a look
          at her PV for the reveal.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Did you know, that her Japanese CV -- Youmiya Hina -- also voices our
              precious and frail Takamatsu Tomori from BanG Dream's MyGO?
            </li>
            <li>
              Shizuku's height, according to her biography, is 157cm -- matching the
              same height of yours truly in VTuber form and IRL!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The Volume 3 of the DOAXVV OST has been released to the Japanese market!
          It's already available on the mainstream music platforms like Amazon Music
          and Spotify, though it requires a Japanese IP to access the service. You can
          do so over VPN.
        </li>
        <li>
          The DOAXVV Communities have been launched following „ÄåJustice @ 6„Äç! You can
          freely join any DOAXVV-related Community of your choice, and maybe, you can
          spot us in one of the feeds!
        </li>
        <li>
          And the Birthday PVs for our beloved Tina have been released! Aligned with
          this, the Commemorative V-Stone Packs have appeared for a limited time; and
          you can watch their PVs when this stream ends.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And with it, it's time to wrap up the Inception Anniversary! It's been a long
        road ahead of us, but together with the rest of the community, we sure all can
        thrive for years to come! On behalf of the SquadMates, this has been
        thebelovedmoon; and for one last time: Otanjobi Omedetou, Tina and
        #MamaNyoSquad!
