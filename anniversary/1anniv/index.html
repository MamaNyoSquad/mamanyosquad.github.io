      <h1>#MamaNyoSquad's 1st Inception Anniversary - Presenter's Transcript</h1>
      <h2>G.Mgr</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for your continued support as we celebrate the 1st Inception Anniversary! I'm
        thebelovedmoon, General Manager of #MamaNyoSquad.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started working on this as just a very basic approach to promoting and relaying
        information from DOAXVV Global Edition since they don't have a Twitter account to work
        with. After experiences and tribulations that happened within a year, I'm still grateful
        that I still can do what I'm most proud of: Preserving the legacy of DOA (starting with
        XVV) for future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I couldn't do it without some of the friends I know that I can lean on; especially
        to the one whom I'm returning the favor: The Social & Web Manager himself, Emmannuel
        Ortega.
      </p>
      <p>
        He'll tell you most of the stuff we're covering to kick off another year of profound
        experiences as we continue to delve into the universe through the eyes of the Tengu.
      </p>
      <h2>SocWeb Mgr</h2>
      <p>
        Hello everyone. My name is Emmannuel Ortega, Social and Web Manager for #MamaNyoSquad.
        Before we begin, I want to thank everyone for continuing to support the Squad at times of
        tribulations. We have gone through a lot throughout the year and we are committed to earn
        our reputation for years to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we kick off our 1st Inception Anniversary, we will begin with our highlights since the
        inception:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mostly by the General Manager, the Squad has been participating in #DeadOrAliveMonday
            for most occasions; the most recent one in-house is the trilogy of The Admirers, where
            the Past, Present and Future come together to commemorate their adventures and how they
            intertwine. They are a part of the Inside Stories of Venus Island Diaries, a
            fanfic-based breakthrough in reconsidering Story Mode in Xtreme Venus Vacation.
          </li>
          <li>
            We are experimenting new ways to engage with our audience, starting with
            #OwnersRoomSaturday. Although that did not initially work out, we are planning to revive
            it in the near future.
          </li>
          <li>
            As we loom into the end of the year, we have been exercising with a lot of presentation
            elements to solidify our presence as a brand and as a part of the community. For most
            cases, I am handling the graphics, from the general animations to the countdown that you
            witnessed at the beginning of this premiere. A special thanks to PowerPoint and Movie
            Studio Platinum for providing the tools needed to create those graphics.
          </li>
          <li>
            #MamaNyo19 is our turning point as we are not only celebrating Nyotengu's birthday/special
            day, we incepted our own YouTube channel. You may be wondering, what is so special about
            that channel? Not only we are able to put most of our things in there, we are planning to
            do broadcasts of our general activities as well as special streams in the future.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This will not be possible if it were not for our friends and the members of the community, as
        well as the Squad's followers as we achieved the 100-follower mark. For the second time,
        arigatou gozaimasu.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are returning the floor to thebelovedmoon for the future events that we will be undergoing
        in order to keep things engaging and fun.
      </p>
      <h2>G.Mgr</h2>
      <p>
        First things first, we've announced on VIDiaries' Twitter account that the graphics have
        undergone a big overhaul, starting with the Printables of its Inside Stories. Presentation-wise,
        we rely on SocWeb Mgr's ideas in order to present these graphics. We've also improved our Main
        Story in terms of graphics and workflow as we proceed further through 3 new chapters to be
        released as a part of the Preview. We're expecting the overhaul to complete on January 2022, and
        it'll reflect with the newest batch as soon as they come in.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've also released the Reader Feedback Form in order to give readers their thoughts on the whole
        series and to contribure to the story. We initially released the form upon releasing of the
        trilogy, and we're integrating it to future Inside Stories which are distributed through Revue
        Newsletter. The form is powered by Google Forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, #DeadOrAliveMonday Hall of Fame - 2021. At the moment, he is working on canvassing the
        presentation as fast as possible before we hit 28 December. We're expecting to premiere on 31
        December, just hours before New Year's Day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving on with Atelier Ryza × DOAXVV Global Edition, it marked its first anniversary of the Event
        Festival Collaboration last 3 December. For this, we'll be playing one of the background music
        (BGMs) in lieu of the event. We can't imagine how our Resident Reisalin is excited about it since
        July!
      </p>
      <p>
        And last but not the least, Monthly Nyo! We've retired its integration to Twitter Moments as we
        transition to provide content on our YouTube channel starting from October. As we head to 2022,
        we'll provide the freshest presentation to commemorate the life of Mama Nyo across different
        games and genres, still with the same workflow: Maximum of 15 winners, unveiled every end of the
        month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, that you still continued to support our endeavors despite
        everything. We promise to deliver you only the best ones that you can't see anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm giving the floor back to the SocWeb Mgr as he has other things to say before we go. This has
        been thebelovedmoon, G.Mgr; signing out.
      </p>
      <h2>SocWeb Mgr</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you very much. Before we wrap this program, I would like to take this opportunity to invite
        everyone to DOAXVV Japanese Edition's special live session on the 15th of December. The special
        guests are 2 of the Japanese VAs of the game: The Icon, Miss Akemi Satou; and Miss Shiori Mikami.
        Please head over to this URL displayed below for details: <i>https://doax-venusvacation.jp/info/26477.html</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        And the OST blooms into the morning sun! The official album of DOAXVV has been debuted since the
        25th of November to commemorate its 4th Anniversary since the original release, alas, by public
        demand. Although we would like to notify everyone that it is exclusive to Japan at the moment.
        We have included everything you need to know in the footage we uploaded beforehand, which can be
        located on the Info Bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for joining us as we commemorate the 1st Inception Anniversary, and we may hope for more
        commemorations to come. This has been Emmannuel Ortega, SocWeb Mgr; and we will catch you later.
